.SH NAME
.PP
dskmgr \- Two dimensional, dynamic desktop/workspace manager for bspwm
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
dskmgrd [\-h|\-v|\[en]wm \f[I]WINDOW_MANAGER\f[R]]
.PP
dskmgr COMMAND [\f[I]OPTIONS\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Dskmgr handles bspwm operations such as creating new desktops, focusing
desktops and moving around based on directions.
For example, it can allow your desktop layout to look like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[0\-2]       [2\-2]
[0\-1]       [2\-1] [3\-1]
[0\-0] [1\-0] [2\-0] [3\-0]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Where each number pair is a unique desktop, and you can navigate around
in 4 directions.
The program also remembers you vertical position\[cq]s history, so if
you were in \f[C][0\-1]\f[R] and moved right to \f[C]1\-0\f[R], when you
will move left again you will return to \f[C][0\-1]\f[R] rather than
\f[C][0\-0]\f[R].
.SH DSKMGRD
.PP
Dskmgr runs as a daemon (\f[C]dskmgrd\f[R]), and is controlled through
\f[C]dskmgr\f[R] which communicates with the daemon through a socket.

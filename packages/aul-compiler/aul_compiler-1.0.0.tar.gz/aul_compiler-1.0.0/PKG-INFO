# Introduction
Annoyingly Uncodeable Language (AUL), officially The Annoyingly Uncodeable Language Project, is an [esoteric programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) developed by [Andrew Chen](https://github.com/actiniumn404) that aims to be so hard to code that it is annoying. The AUL compiler is freely available [on GitHub](https://github.com/actiniumn404/Annoyingly-Uncodeable-Language) where it is licensed under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/actiniumn404/Annoyingly-Uncodeable-Language/blob/main/LICENSE). Our tutorial assumes that you have a decent experience in computer science, specifically in the Python language, so if you don't, try and learn a programming language like Python first. Without further ado, let's dive into the tutorial!

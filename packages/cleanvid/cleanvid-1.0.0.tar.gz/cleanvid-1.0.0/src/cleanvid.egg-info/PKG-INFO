# cleanvid

![Docker Image](https://github.com/mmguero/cleanvid/workflows/cleanvid-build-push-ghcr/badge.svg)

cleanvid is a little script to mute profanity in video files in a few simple steps:

1. The user provides as input a video file and matching .srt subtitle file. If subtitles are not provided, [`subliminal`](https://github.com/Diaoul/subliminal) is used to attempt to download the best matching .srt file.
2. [`pysrt`](https://github.com/byroot/pysrt) is used to parse the .srt file, and each entry is checked against a [list](swears.txt) of profanity or other words or phrases you'd like muted. Mappings can be provided (eg., map "sh*t" to "poop"), otherwise the word will be replaced with *****.
3. A new "clean" .srt file is created. with *only* those phrases containing the censored/replaced objectional language.
4. [`ffmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) is used to create a cleaned video file. This file contains the original video stream, but the audio stream is muted during the segments containing objectional language. The audio stream is re-encoded as AAC and remultiplexed back together with the video.

You can then use your favorite media player to play the cleaned video file together with the cleaned srt file.

cleanvid is part of a family of projects with similar goals:

* ðŸ“¼ [cleanvid](https://github.com/mmguero/cleanvid) for video files
* ðŸŽ¤ [monkeyplug](https://github.com/mmguero/monkeyplug) for audio files
* ðŸ“• [montag](https://github.com/mmguero/montag) for ebooks

### Docker

Alternately, a [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) is provided to allow you to run cleanvid in Docker. You can build the `mmguero/cleanvid:latest` Docker image with [`build_docker.sh`](./docker/build_docker.sh), then run [`cleanvid-docker.sh`](./docker/cleanvid-docker.sh) inside the directory where your video/subtitle files are located.

## Typing stubs for PyYAML

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `PyYAML` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `PyYAML`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/PyYAML. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `a40d79a4e63c4e750a8d3a8012305da942251eb4`.

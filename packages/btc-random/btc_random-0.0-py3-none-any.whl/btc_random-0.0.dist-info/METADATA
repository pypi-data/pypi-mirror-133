# Uses the randomness of the bitcoin to generate a random number

Illustrates the randomness of the bitcoin. 

Yes this is a satire / half joke

To use : 
```py
from btc_random import btc

print(btc.random())
```

This will fetch the current rate of the bitcoin and return a random number between 0 and 1 using the rate as the seed.

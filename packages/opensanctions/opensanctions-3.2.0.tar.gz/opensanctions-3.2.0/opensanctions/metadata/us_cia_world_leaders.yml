  From the CIA [web site](https://www.cia.gov/resources/world-leaders/):

  > The CIA publishes and updates the online directory of World Leaders and
  > Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments weekly. The directory is intended
  > to be used primarily as a reference aid and includes as many governments
  > of the world as is considered practical, some of them not officially
  > recognized by the United States. Regimes with which the United States has
  > no diplomatic exchanges are indicated by the initials NDE. Governments
  > are listed according to the most commonly used version of each countryâ€™s
  > name. The spelling of the personal names in this directory follows
  > transliteration systems generally agreed upon by US Government agencies,
  > except in the cases in which officials have stated a preference for alternate
  > spellings of their names.
  > 
  > NOTE: Although the head of the central bank is listed for each country,
  > in most cases he or she is not a Cabinet member. Ambassadors to the United
  > States and Permanent Representatives to the UN, New York, have also been
  > included.

prefix: evpo
summary: >
  All members of national parliament in the world, collected from hundreds of
  government web sites and consolidated via Wikidata.
description: |
  The EveryPolitician project ran until 2019 and created a mechanism for consolidating 
  data about members of parliament for 233 different countries and territories. As part
  of the project, EveryPolitician operated a large fleet of crawlers which read the web
  sites of parliaments around the world.

  The project was [shut down in June 2019](https://www.mysociety.org/2019/06/26/placing-everypolitician-on-hold/), 
  leaving the contained data to slowly wither in precision.

  **Update, January 2022*: The [Peppercat Legislators](https://www.opensanctions.org/datasets/wd_peppercat_legislators/)
  dataset will succeed EveryPolitician. It generates membership data from Wikidata,
  which is currently incomplete in some jurisdictions. Going forward, the intention is
  to use the EveryPolitician scrapers to update membership data in Wikidata.

  The OpenSanctions importer only includes individuals active within the past 15 years.

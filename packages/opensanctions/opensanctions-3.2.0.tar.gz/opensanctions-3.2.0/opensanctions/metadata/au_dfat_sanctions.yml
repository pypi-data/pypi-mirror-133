  The Consolidated List is a list of all persons and entities who are subject to
  targeted financial sanctions under Australian sanctions law. Those listed may be
  Australian citizens, foreign nationals, or residents in Australia or overseas.

  Australia implements two types of sanctions:

  * United Nations Security Council (UNSC) sanctions, which Australia must impose as
    a member of the UN.
  * Australian autonomous sanctions, which are imposed as a matter of Australian
    foreign policy.

  ASO maintains the list and updates it regularly.

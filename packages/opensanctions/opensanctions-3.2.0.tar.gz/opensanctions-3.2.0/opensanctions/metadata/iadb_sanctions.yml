  Sanctions are meant to prevent and deter Prohibited Practices in IDB

    the accused firms and/or individuals to respond to the allegations
    pursuant to the Sanctions Procedures;
  * Negotiated Resolution Agreements entered between the Bank Group and
    companies or individuals as a result of investigations undertaken by
    OII; OR

    has been made effective by the Inter-American Development Bank,
    World Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction
    and Development, and African Development Bank

  In accordance with the IDB Group’s Sanctions Procedures, the Sanctions
  Officer and Sanctions Committee may impose any sanction that it deems
  to be appropriate under the circumstances, including but not limited
  to reprimand, debarment, conditional non-debarment, and conditions on
  future contracting. Debarred firms or individuals are ineligible to be
  awarded and participate in any IDB financed contract for the periods
  indicated.  Ineligibility may extend to any firm or individual who
  directly or indirectly controls the debarred firm or any firm which the
  debarred firm directly or indirectly controls. In the case of a debarred

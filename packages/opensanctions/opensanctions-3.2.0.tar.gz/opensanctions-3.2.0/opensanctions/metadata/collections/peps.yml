  A politically exposed person (PEP) is a person that has been entrusted with
  a prominent public function. PEPs include elected officials, members of
  government.

  Integrating data about political actors is an essential step in making
  an open source due diligence database. However, it is a much more intricate
  task than collecting sanctions lists (of which there are only a few dozen),
  and fully addressing it will be the focus of a later stage of this project.

  At present, OpenSanctions relies mainly on the efforts of the now-defunct
  [EveryPolitician](https://everypolitician.org) project to include law makers
  from many countries.

#  EveryPolitician is soon to be superseded by the new
#   [Peppercat](http://peppercat.org/) initiative, which aims to keep the
#   information on political office holders in [Wikidata](https://wikidata.org)
#   up-to-date. Please visit the Peppecat site to learn more about that
#   effort and how you can support it.

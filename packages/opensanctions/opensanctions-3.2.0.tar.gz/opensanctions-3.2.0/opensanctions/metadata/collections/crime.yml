type: collection
title: Warrants and Criminal Entities
summary: >
  Companies and people implicated in or convicted of criminal activity,
  including the "Most Wanted" lists of various countries and international
  authorities.
description: |
  This collection combines entities which have been involved in some form of
  criminal proceeding. The focus lies on corporate and financial fraud, and
  political crimes. These actions can be considered adjacent to economic 
  and military sanctions and be included in the same vetting process.

  In the future, we hope to expand into several deep dives on specific subject
  areas:

  * Procurement exclusion (debarment) of companies involved in irregularities
    in state contracts.
  * Individuals or companies banned from operating as corporate officers in
    one or more jurisdictions.
  * Companies involved in corruption in their own country or abroad (FCPA).
  * Companies known the be used to facilitate money laundering (laundromats).
  * Individuals or companies that have declared bankruptcy or insolvency in
    some sensational way.

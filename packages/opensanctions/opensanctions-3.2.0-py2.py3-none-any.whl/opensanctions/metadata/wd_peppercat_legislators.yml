  Peppercat Legislators collects membership information about national-level legislatures
  from Wikidata. This dataset attempts to replicate the contents of
  [EveryPolitician](https://www.opensanctions.org/datasets/everypolitician/) based on the
  information uploaded to Wikidata. In the future, the crawlers that have previously been 
  used to build EveryPolitician will be replaced by ones that will update Wikidata to
  reflect the information presented on national parliamentary web sites.

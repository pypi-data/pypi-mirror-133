"""
Usage: `python trace_docs_deps.py [DOCS_DIR]`

This script is used in our Azure Docs Integration pipeline (azure-pipelines-docs-integration.yml) to determine whether
a change has been made in the `great_expectations/` directory that change impacts `docs/` and the snippets therein.

The script takes the following steps:
    1. Parses all markdown files in `docs/`, using regex to find any Docusaurus links (i.e. ```python file=...#L10-20)
    2. Goes to each linked file and uses AST to parse imports used there
    3. Filters for only relative imports and determines the paths to those files

The resulting output list is all of the dependencies `docs/` has on the primary `great_expectations/` directory.
If a change is identified in any of these files during the pipeline runtime, we know that a docs dependency has possibly
been impacted and the pipeline should run to ensure adequate test coverage.

Please note that this solution has some inherit disclaimers one should be familiar with. As there is no actual execution
of source code (but rather parsing of the source file's AST), it is hard to pinpoint the location of a given import with
absolute certainty.  Utilizing the `__file__` attr would provide the exact path of an import but without that, we need
to assume that an `ast.Import` node corresponds to an accurate path in our codebase (ex: `great_expectations.core.batch`
results in great_expectations/core/batch.py).

As long as imports correspond to the relative path of modules, this method will continue to work as intended. Deviations
here could result in certain imports not being picked up by the script, reducing the accuracy and frequency of the
Azure Docs Integration pipeline's triggers. As GE has maintained this consistency throughout its development, this
script and the methods used herein are deemed to be appropriate.

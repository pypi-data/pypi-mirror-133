Description: # Signal Creator
        
        This is the signal creator Package developed by Camilo Rey, to 
        create periodic signals that are _flavored_ by stochastic noise and
        _perturbations_ following a deceptively simple mathematical model. 
        
        There are two main components in this package (i.e. sub-packages). The 
        *functions* package where the basic signal functions are located 
        (i.e. periodic functions and gaussian noise) to create signals that
        can be sampled (automatically to 100 points), and the *perturbation* 
        subpackage that allows us to extend a base class _Perturbation_ to 
        mess basic harmonic signals.

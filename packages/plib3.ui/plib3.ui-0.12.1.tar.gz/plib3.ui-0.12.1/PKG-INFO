Description: The PLIB3.UI package contains a simple framework for
        writing user interfaces in Python. The aim is to provide
        two main features:
        
        - It lets the same high-level code work with a number of
          different underlying user interface toolkits, by
          providing higher-level abstractions of UI functions.
        
        - It allows you to express the layout of your UI declaratively
          using Python lists and dicts, and to focus on the code
          specific to your application with a minimum of boilerplate.
        
        This package is intended as a replacement for the old ``plib.gui``
        package, providing substantially the same underlying GUI support
        but with a simpler and easier to use interface.
        
        The ``setup.py`` script for PLIB3.UI uses the ``setuputils``
        helper module, which helps to automate away much of the
        boilerplate in Python setup scripts. This module is available
        as a separate release at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuputils3.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install PLIB3.UI, you can simply run::
        
            $ python3 setup.py install
        
        at a shell prompt from the directory into which you
        unzipped the source tarball (the same directory that this
        README file is in). This will install PLIB3 and then
        run each of the post-install scripts in the scripts
        directory.
        
        Example Programs
        ----------------
        
        PLIB3.UI comes with example programs that illustrate key features
        of the package. After installation, these can be found in the
        ``$PREFIX/share/plib/examples`` directory. If you have a
        POSIX system (Linux or Mac OSX), the ``plib-setup-examples``
        post-install script will install symlinks to the example
        programs in the ``$PREFIX/bin`` directory.

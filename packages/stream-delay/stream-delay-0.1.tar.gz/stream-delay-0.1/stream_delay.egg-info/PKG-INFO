Stream a file or stdin one line at a time with a delay

## Installation

Install this tool using `pip`:

    $ pip install stream-delay

## Usage

Feed content to this tool either by piping to standard input or using one or more filenames.

The tool will output the data from those inputs one line at a time with a 100ms delay between each line.

You can use `-d 500` to change the delay to another value expressed in milliseconds.

Examples:

- `cat myfile.txt | stream-delay` - will stream from that file with a 100ms delay between each line
- `stream-delay myfile.txt` - same as above, this time using the filename
- `stream-delay myfile.txt myfile2.txt` - streams from the first file, then the second file
- `stream-delay myfile.txt -d 1000` - streams from that file with a one second delay between each line

## Development

To contribute to this tool, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment:

    cd stream-delay
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

Or if you are using `pipenv`:

    pipenv shell

Now install the dependencies and test dependencies:

    pip install -e '.[test]'

To run the tests:

    pytest

		<h2>Welcome to the Help Documentation</h2>
		<p>
			This is the user guide for nscalc, the following sections
			will quide you through the various components of the application
		</p>
		<p>
			for a more indepth guide to things like installation and contributing
			see the README.md from <a href="https://github.com/Krayfighter/nscalc.git/README.md">the github page</a>
		</p>
		<h4>Jump to a Section ↓</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#ui">User Interface and Design</a></li>
			<li><a href="#inputs">Inputs Methods</a></li>
			<li><a href="#dialogs">Other Dialogs</a></li>
			<li><a href="#advanced">Advanced Usage</a></li>
			<li><a href="#extensions">Extending nscalc</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h3><a name="ui">The UI</a></h3>
		<p>
			One of the goals of nscalc if for a simple,
			and practicle user inter (UI) one of the few
			ui elements that may need explaining is the
			View -> Loaded Functions menu. what it does
			it it programatically displays the functions,
			and constants (like tan, and sin, or pi, and e).
		</p>
		<h4>special buttons</h4>
		<p>
			there are several button, particularly at
			the bottom of the calculator. the buttons
			are labeled by &#187;, &#171;, and &#8592;
		</p>
		<p>
			&#8592;is used for deleting the right-most
			character from the current equation.
		</p>
		<p>
			The &#171;, and &#187; are for loading the
			previous inputs to the calculator. for instance
			if you were to mistype a command, and it returns
			and error, you can use the &#171; to bring it back
			and fix it, or if you go too far back, you
			can come back forward with &#187;
		</p>
		<h4>The File Menu</h4>
		<p>
			Under the File menu, there are currently three actions, or options to click
			the actions are Help, Exit, and Update, and they will be covered by the following
			paragraphs
		</p>
		<h5>Help</h5>
		<p>
			This action opens this document in a new browser tab, and is pretty self
			explanatory.
		</p>
		<h5>Exit</h5>
		<p>
			Again, pretty self explanatory, this action exits the program peacefully
		</p>
		<h5>Update</h5>
		<p>
			This action opens a dialog, or popup that displays text saying that it is attempting
			to update, and a loading gif. When it is done downloading the update, it will exit
			peacefully, leaving the calculator open. To see the effect of the update, just restart
			the calculator
		</p>
		<h3><a name="inputs">Input Methods</a></h3>
		<p>
			nscalc has two distinct methods for entering
			equations into the calculator. The first is 
			clicking the buttons in the UI (the graphics)
			The second method is to type characters using 
			the keyboard. I have worked to make these input
			methods work seemlessly together
		</p>
		<h3><a name="dialogs">Other Dialogs</a></h3>
		<p>
			If you have gotten to this point, you probably
			have found the File -> Help menu. If you did not
			know already, that opened up this dialog or secondary
			window. there are others though, and they have some
			unique functionalities that will be documented in this
			section of the documentation.
		</p>
		<h4>View -> Loaded Functions</h4>
		<p>
			This menu option opens up a dialog with only one
			feature, a list of functions. these functions can
			be used to perform specific mathematic operations
			and if you click on them, it will copy the function
			into your current equation.
		</p>
		<h3><a name="advanced">Advanced Usage</a></h3>
		<p>
			This section of the article explains advanced
			topics such as large numbers, and ratios that
			are listed below.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>very large numbers</li>
			<li>ratios</li>
		</ul>
		<f4>Large Numbers</f4>
		<p>
			This section covers unreasonably large numbers,
			for example, the mass of the earth 5.9722×10²⁴ kg.
			This number would not fit into a normal python Integer
			so there are ways around that. nscalc uses E
			notation for such numbers, which you can learn about
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation#E_notation">here</a>.
			The function for this is in nscalc is called <code>enotation</code>, and it takes
			a number inside of quotes like this -> enotation('5.9722e24')
		</p>
		<f4>Ratios</f4>
		<p>
			*-* Not Yet Implemented
		</p>
		<h3><a name="extensions">Extending nscalc</a></h3>
		<p>
			<b>* waring * for advanced users only, use at your own risk.</b> this will also
			require a previous knowledge of the python programming language, but is
			otherwise intended to be straight-forward enough for one to learn just
			enough of the language and still be able to write extensions.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you do not know python and would like to learn, visit the official webiste at
			<a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">their website</a>
		</p>
		<h4>Creating a new extension</h4>
		<p>
			All extensions in nscalc are stored in the extensions folder inside of the nscalc
			source code. If you cannot find it, then post a problem on the github, and i will
			add a way to help you 
		</p>
		<p>
			Now that you are in the extensions folder, create a new python file inside of it.
			the name of this file will be the name of your extension
		</p>
		<h4>Add code to your extension</h4>
		<p>
			in the extensions folder, there will be 2 files before you even get there, they
			are `__init__.py` (<b>do not touch this one</b>), and examples.py. in your favorite
			text editor/ide, open example.py, and the python file that you created.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you look inside the examples file, it is pretty simple, as I tried to make
			extending nscalc simple, and all you have to do is define a function as you would
			normally * note * try to make sure that the function name you are using does not already
			exist, as it can override other functions, or be overriden by pre-existing functions.
		</p>
		<h4>Using your extension</h4>
		<p>
			Now you can restart nscalc, and under the View -> Loaded Functions dialog find
			your extension. If it is not there, or something has gone wrong, please try
			re-reading, and troubleshooting, and afterwards wether you find an answer or not
			post a problem, and/or a solution under the github page.

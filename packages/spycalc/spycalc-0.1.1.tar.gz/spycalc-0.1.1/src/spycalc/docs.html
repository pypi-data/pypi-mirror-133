		<h2>Welcome to the Help Documentation</h2>
		<p>
			This is the user guide for spycalc, the following sections
			will quide you through the various components of the application
		</p>
		<p>
			for a more indepth guide to things like installation and contributing
			see the README.md from <a href="https://github.com/Krayfighter/spycalc/#readme">the github page</a>

		</ul>
		<h3><a name="ui">The UI</a></h3>
		<p>
			One of the goals of spycalc if for a simple,
			and practicle user inter (UI) one of the few
			ui elements that may need explaining is the
			View -> Loaded Functions menu. what it does
			it it programatically displays the functions,
			and constants (like tan, and sin, or pi, and e).
		</p>
		<h4>special buttons</h4>
		<p>
			there are several button, particularly at
			the bottom of the calculator. the buttons
			are labeled by &#187;, &#171;, and &#8592;
		</p>
		<p>
			&#8592;is used for deleting the right-most
			character from the current equation.
		</p>
		<p>
			The &#171;, and &#187; are for loading the
			previous inputs to the calculator. for instance
			if you were to mistype a command, and it returns
			and error, you can use the &#171; to bring it back
			and fix it, or if you go too far back, you
			can come back forward with &#187;
		</p>
		<h4>The File Menu</h4>
		<p>
			Under the File menu, there are currently three actions, or options to click
			the actions are Help, Exit, and Update, and they will be covered by the following
			paragraphs
		</p>
		<h5>Help</h5>
		<p>
			This action opens this document in a new browser tab, and is pretty self
			explanatory.
		</p>
		<h5>Exit</h5>
		<p>
			Again, pretty self explanatory, this action exits the program peacefully
		</p>
		<h5>Update</h5>
		<p>
			This action opens a dialog, or popup that displays text saying that it is attempting
			to update, and a loading gif. When it is done downloading the update, it will exit
			peacefully, leaving the calculator open. To see the effect of the update, just restart
			the calculator
		</p>
		<h3><a name="inputs">Input Methods</a></h3>
		<p>
			spycalc has two distinct methods for entering
			equations into the calculator. The first is 
			clicking the buttons in the UI (the graphics)
			The second method is to type characters using 
			the keyboard. I have worked to make these input
			methods work seemlessly together
		</p>
		<h3><a name="dialogs">Other Dialogs</a></h3>
		<p>
			If you have gotten to this point, you probably
			have found the File -> Help menu. That opened up this
			browser window. There are others though, and they have some
			unique functionalities that will be covered in this
			section of the documentation.
		</p>
		<h4>View -> Loaded Functions</h4>
		<p>
			This menu option opens up a dialog with only one
			feature, a list of functions. these functions can
			be used to perform specific mathematic operations
			and if you click on them, it will copy the function
			into your current equation.
		</p>
		<h3><a name="advanced">Advanced Usage</a></h3>
		<p>
			This section of the article is becoming largely
			deprecated, but may still be helpfull to those
			interested in some of the fine details of spycalc
		</p>
		<f4>Large Numbers</f4>
		<p>
			This section covers unreasonably large numbers,
			for example, the mass of the earth 5.9722×10²⁴ kg.
			This number would not fit into a normal python Integer
			so there are ways around that. spycalc uses E
			notation for such numbers, which you can learn about
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation#E_notation">here</a>.
			As of spycalc version 0.1.0 this has become automatically enforced
			by the equation interpretation system. large numbers may be written raw,
			or in E notation as shown below (example using earth's mass)-><br />
			normal: 597220000000000000000000<br />
			E notation: 5.9722e24
		</p>
		<f4>Ratios</f4>
		<p>
			*-* Not Yet Implemented<br />
			These will be helpfull for things like geometry, and
			are implemented in most geometry scripts, but are not supported in
			raw spycalc yet.
		</p>
		<h3><a name="extensions">Extending spycalc</a></h3>
		<p>
			<b>* warning * for advanced users only, use at your own risk.</b><br />
			<b>* warning * only for dev mode install of spycalc</b><br />
			This requires having installed spycalc through the "Development Mode".
			This will also require a previous knowledge of the python programming language, but is
			otherwise intended to be straight-forward enough for people of all skill
			levels to learn and use.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you do not know python and would like to learn, visit
			<a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">the official website</a>
		</p>
		<h4>Creating a new extension</h4>
		<p>
			<!-- All extensions in spycalc are stored in the extensions folder. Open spycalc's folder and you will
			see a folder called "src". enter the folder src/spycalc/extensions. -->
			Werever you have install spycalc, open the folder. In this folder are nested several folders.
			Enter src/spycalc/extenstions from within the spycalc root folder.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now that you are in the extensions folder, create a new python file inside of it.
			the name of this file will be the name of your extension
		</p>
		<h4>Add code to your extension</h4>
		<p>
			in the extensions folder, there will be several files before you even get there, they
			are `__init__.py` (<b>do not touch this one</b>), and examples.py (<b>you can modify this one</b>).
			In your favorite
			text editor/ide, open example.py, and the python file that you created.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you look inside the examples file, it is pretty simple, as I tried to make
			extending spycalc simple, and all you have to do is define a function as you would
			normally. <i>(* note * try to make sure that the function name you are using does not already
			exist, as it can override other functions, or be overriden by pre-existing functions.)</i>
		</p>
		<h4>Using your extension</h4>
		<p>
			Now you can restart spycalc, and under the View -> Loaded Functions dialog find
			your extension. If it is not there, or something has gone wrong, please try
			re-reading, and troubleshooting, and afterwards wether you find an answer or not
			post a problem, and/or a solution under the github page.

# General Information

`biopeaks` is a straightforward graphical user interface for feature extraction from electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG) and breathing biosignals.
It processes these biosignals semi-automatically with sensible defaults and offers the following functionality:

+ processes files in the open biosignal formats [EDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Data_Format), [OpenSignals (Bitalino)](https://bitalino.com/en/software)
as well as plain text files (.txt, .csv, .tsv)
+ interactive biosignal visualization
+ biosignal segmentation
+ benchmarked, automatic extrema detection (R-peaks in ECG, systolic peaks in PPG, exhalation troughs and inhalation
peaks in breathing signals) with signal-specific, sensible defaults
+ automatic state-of-the-art [artifact correction](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03091902.2019.1640306)
 for ECG and PPG extrema
+ manual editing of extrema
+ extraction of instantaneous features: (heart- or breathing-) rate and period, as well as breathing amplitude
+ .csv export of extrema and instantaneous features for further analysis (e.g., heart rate variability)
+ automatic analysis of multiple files (batch processing)

# Installation

`biopeaks` can be installed from PyPI:

```
pip install biopeaks
```

Alternatively, on Windows, download [biopeaks.exe](https://github.com/JanCBrammer/biopeaks/releases/latest)
and run it. Running the executable does not require a Python installation.

You can find more details on the installation [here](https://jancbrammer.github.io/biopeaks/installation.html).

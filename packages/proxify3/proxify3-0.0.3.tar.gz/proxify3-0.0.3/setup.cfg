description = A version of the original proxify by Somdev Sangwan that is compatable for recent versions of python.  I was recommended his tool, but upon trying to get it from pip/pip3 I encountered version errors. So I decided to download his source code, see the compatability problem, fix it, and reupload it to PyPi as proxify3

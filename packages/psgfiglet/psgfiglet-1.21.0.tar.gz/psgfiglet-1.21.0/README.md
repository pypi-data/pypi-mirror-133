  <h2 align="center">Figlet Creation</h2>
</p>

Create Figlets easily using this application created using PySimpleGUI.

## Installation

### Old-school Straight Pip

pip install psgfiglet

### pip via `python -m pip` the python recommended way

#### If `python` is your command

python -m pip install psgfiglet

#### If `python3` is your command

python3 -m pip install psgfiglet

## Usage

To run the program and create your own Figlets type from your command prompt:

psgfiglet




## About - What is a Figlet?

A Figlet is a text based way to add large block text to your code or chats.  There are a variety of "Fonts" available that you'll find listed along the left side of the screen.

![psgfiglet](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46163555/137602353-fe721a9b-271a-48b7-b121-8277f8035633.jpg)


## To use in your code

The easiest way to is make a multiline string in your code using triple quotes:

```python

'''
This is a multiline string
Line 2
'''
```


You can simply paste your Figlet into one of these multiline comments.  They work well at breaking up your code into chunks

```python

'''
                    oo          
                                
88d8b.d8b. .d8888b. dP 88d888b. 
88'`88'`88 88'  `88 88 88'  `88 
88  88  88 88.  .88 88 88    88 
dP  dP  dP `88888P8 dP dP    dP
'''

def main():
    x = 20

```


## Windows Special Instructions

Want to make this install even more usable on Windows?

Head over to the PySimpleGUI Demo Programs and get the program:
[Demo_Make_Windows_Shortcut](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/blob/master/DemoPrograms/Demo_Make_Windows_Shortcut.pyw)

Use this program to make a shortcut to psgfiglet that you can then put on your desktop or pin  to your taskbar or ???

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46163555/137819608-b590d1c6-2600-45b9-a4b2-491ead759ca3.png)


To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open a command window (I promise, it's the last time you'll need to for this program)
2. Type - where psgfiglet
3. Copy the line that "where psgfiglet" gave you into the first input of the shortcut maker program
4. Run psgfiglet
5. Right click and choose "File Location"
6. Copy the file location results, but change the extension from .py to .ico and paste into the Icon file input of the shortcut maker
7. Click "Create Shortcut"

This will create a shortcut in the same folder as the psgfiglet.exe file.  You can safely move this shortcut file to any place you want (like to your desktop).  Double-click the shortcut and psgfiglet should launch.

This program originated with user [nycynik](https://github.com/nycynik).with his [ascii-font-processor](https://github.com/nycynik/ascii-font-processor) project.

Then Mike from the PySimpleGUI project started with his project and modified it.

It's one of the many PySimpleGUI-based programs I use daily. It's the first in a series of "Application Releases" that are hosted on PyPI.org

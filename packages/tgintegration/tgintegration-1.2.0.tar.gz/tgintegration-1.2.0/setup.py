The bot under test is https://t.me/BotListBot 🤖\n    client=client,           # This assumes you already have a Pyrogram user client available\n    max_wait=8,              # Maximum timeout for responses (optional)\n    wait_consecutive=2,      # Minimum time to wait for more/consecutive messages (optional)\n    raise_no_response=True,  # Raise `InvalidResponseError` when no response is received (defaults to True)\n    global_action_delay=2.5  # Choosing a rather high delay so we can observe what\'s happening (optional)\n)\n\nawait controller.clear_chat()  # Start with a blank screen (⚠️)\n```\n\nNow, let\'s send `/start` to the bot and wait until exactly three messages have been received by using the asynchronous `collect` context manager:\n\n``` python\nasync with controller.collect(count=3) as response:\n    await controller.send_command("start")\n\nassert response.num_messages == 3  # Three messages received, bundled under a `Response` object\nassert response.messages[0].sticker  # The first message is a sticker\n```\n\nThe result should look like this:\n\n![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JosXa/tgintegration/master/docs/assets/start_botlistbot.png)\n\nExamining the buttons in the response...\n\n``` python\n# Get first (and only) inline keyboard from the replies\ninline_keyboard = response.inline_keyboards[0]\n\n# Three buttons in the first row\nassert len(inline_keyboard.rows[0]) == 3\n```\n\nWe can also press the inline keyboard buttons, for example based on a regular expression:\n\n``` python\nexamples = await inline_keyboard.click(pattern=r".*Examples")\n```\n\nAs the bot edits the message, `.click()` automatically listens for "message edited" updates and returns\nthe new state as another `Response`.\n\n![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JosXa/tgintegration/master/docs/assets/examples_botlistbot.png)\n\n``` python\nassert "Examples for contributing to the BotList" in examples.full_text\n```\n\n#### Error handling\n\nSo what happens when we send an invalid query or the peer fails to respond?\n\nThe following instruction will raise an `InvalidResponseError` after `controller.max_wait` seconds.\nThis is because we passed `raise_no_response=True` during controller initialization.\n\n``` python\ntry:\n    async with controller.collect():\n        await controller.send_command("ayylmao")\nexcept InvalidResponseError:\n    pass  # OK\n```\n\nLet\'s explicitly set `raise_` to `False` so that no exception occurs:\n\n``` python\nasync with controller.collect(raise_=False) as response:\n    await client.send_message(controller.peer_id, "Henlo Fren")\n```\n\nIn this case, _tgintegration_ will simply emit a warning, but you can still assert\nthat no response has been received by using the `is_empty` property:\n\n``` python\nassert response.is_empty\n```\n\n\nIntegrating with Test Frameworks\n--------------------------------\n\n### [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/index.html)\n\nPytest is the recommended test framework for use with _tgintegration_. You can\n[browse through several examples](https://github.com/JosXa/tgintegration/tree/master/examples/pytest)\nand _tgintegration_ also uses pytest for its own test suite.\n\n### unittest\n\nI haven\'t tried out the builtin `unittest` library in combination with _tgintegration_ yet,\nbut theoretically I don\'t see any problems with it.\nIf you do decide to try it, it would be awesome if you could tell me about your\nexperience and whether anything could be improved 🙂\nLet us know at 👉 https://t.me/TgIntegration or in an issue.\n',

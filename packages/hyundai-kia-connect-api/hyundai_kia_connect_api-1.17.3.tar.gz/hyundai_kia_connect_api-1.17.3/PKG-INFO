Introduction
============
This is a Kia UVO and Hyundai Bluelink written in python.  It is primary consumed by home assistant.  If you are looking for a home assistant Kia / Hyundai implementation please look here: https://github.com/fuatakgun/kia_uvo.  Much of this base code came from reading bluelinky and contributions to the kia_uvo home assistant project. 


Usage
=====

This package is designed to simplify the complexity of using multiple regions.  It attempts to standardize the usage regardless of what brand or region the car is in.  That isn't always possible though, in particular some features differ from one to the next. 

Vehicle manager is the key class that is called to manage all calls to the API.  One vehicle manager should be used per login. Key data points required to instantiate vehicle manager are: 

region: int
brand: int, 
username: str
password: str
pin: str (required for CA, and potentially USA, otherwise pass a plan str) 

Key values for the int exist in the constant(https://github.com/fuatakgun/hyundai_kia_connect_api/blob/master/hyundai_kia_connect_api/const.py) file as: 

REGIONS = {1: REGION_EUROPE, 2: REGION_CANADA, 3: REGION_USA}
BRANDS = {1: BRAND_KIA, 2: BRAND_HYUNDAI}

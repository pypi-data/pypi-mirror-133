# MathSquare
MathSquare - python library for work with geometric formulas easy.
For example, you can solve a problem with the Pythagorean theorem in one line of code using Mathsquare, while on a "naked" python it may take 5-6 lines of code.

# opportunities
Area calculation

Calculation of the area of a triangle by Heron's theorem

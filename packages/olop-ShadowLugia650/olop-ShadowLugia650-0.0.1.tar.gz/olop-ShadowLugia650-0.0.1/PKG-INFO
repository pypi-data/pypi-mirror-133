# OLOP: One-Line &amp; Obfuscated Python

This repository contains useful python modules for one-line and obfuscated python.

[Wiki](https://github.com/ShadowLugia650/olop/wiki): [FAQ](https://github.com/ShadowLugia650/olop/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) and [OLP Tips and Tricks](https://github.com/ShadowLugia650/olop/wiki/OLP-Tips-and-Tricks)

## One-Line python (olp)
These files are located within ./olp

### [olp.py](https://github.com/ShadowLugia650/olop/blob/master/olp/olp.py): primitives within olp to be imported for olp scripts
 * `__import__("olp").primitives`
 * includes: one-line while loop, one-line do while loop,

### [oldec.py](https://github.com/ShadowLugia650/olop/blob/master/olp/oldec.py): a one-line python decoder file which can be called from a python script. Common Usage:
```
globals().update(oldec = __import__("oldec")) or oldec.beautify(oldec.parse_recursive("SOME_OLP_STRING"))
```
or, for non olp programmers
```
import oldec

code = oldec.beautify(oldec.parse_recursive("SOME_OLP_STRING"))
```
NOTE: oldec.py cannot fully parse any one-line python file, as they can take numerous different forms, and it looks for specific aspects within some one-line python programs (it doesn't work on itself either) 

### [oldec_cmd.py](https://github.com/ShadowLugia650/olop/blob/master/olp/oldec_cmd.py): a one-line python decoding command line utility, for decoding olp outside of a python script. Common Usage:
```
python oldec_cmd.py <olp_file.py> -r -b
```
`python oldec_cmd.py` can also be used to see usage information.

## Obfuscated Python
Prototyping this is still a work in progress.

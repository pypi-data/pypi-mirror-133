        # Note Taking Simplified
        
        ### Overview
        
        *nts* is pure python and will run on any platform that supports python >= 3.7.3. It runs in a terminal window that should be configured to use a fixed width (monospaced) font. _Menlo Regular_ for OSX and _DejaVu Sans Mono_ for Linux are good choices.
        
        Notes are recorded in plain text files with the extension ".txt" that are located anywhere below the *nts* data directory. These note files have a simple format:
        
        * The first line of the note file must contain a *note title line*.
        
        * All *note title lines* must begin with a "+" in the first column followed by a space and then the title of the note.
        
        * Tags, if given, must be comma separated and enclosed in parentheses after the note title.
        
        * The *note body* begins on the next line and continues until another *note title line* or the end of the file is reached.
        
        * Lines that begin with one or more white space characters and then "+" are treated as part of the *note body* and not as the beginning of a new note.
        
        * White space in the *note body* is preserved but whitespace between notes is ignored.
        
        * Using spaces in directory and note file names should be avoided.
        
        
        
        Suppose, e.g., that the *nts* data directory contains a single file
        
        	~/nts/data/parent/child/grandchild.txt
        
        with this content:
        
            ---------------- grandchild.txt begins ---------------
            + note a (red, green)
                The body of note a goes here
        
            + note b (blue, green)
                The body of note b here
        
            + note c (red, blue)
                And the body of note c here
            ---------------- grandchild.txt ends -----------------
        
        *nts* provides two main **views** of this data.
        
        * Path View:
        
                └── parent 1
                    └── child 2
                        └── grandchild.txt 3
                                + note a (red, green) 3-1
                                + note b (blue, green) 3-2
                                + note c (red, blue) 3-3
        
        * Tag View:
        
                ├── blue 1
                │       + note b (blue, green) 1-1
                │       + note c (red, blue) 1-2
                ├── green 2
                │       + note a (red, green) 2-1
                │       + note b (blue, green) 2-2
                └── red 3
                        + note a (red, green) 3-1
                        + note c (red, blue) 3-2
        
        Both views are outlines with branches that end with note title lines. In path view, the nodes along the branches correspond to directory or file names and there can be many of these in each branch. In tag view, on the other hand, the nodes correspond to tag names and there can only be one of these in each branch.
        
        The numeric identifiers appended to the lines in both views are provided by *nts*. These are single numbers for the *nodes* in the outline branches that have children and hyphenated numbers for the *leaves*, e.g., the "3" appended to the "grandchild.txt" node in the path view and the "2-1" appended to "+ note a (red, green)" in the tag view. The first of the two numbers in the leaf identifier is the indentifier of the parent node. These identifiers are used in various ways that are explained below.
        
        
        ### Usage
        
        *nts* provides two ways of interacting with the data.
        
        * Command mode
        
            Commands are entered at the terminal prompt. E.g., enter
        
        		$ nts -v p
        
        	to display the path view in the terminal window. The output can also be piped in the standard way, e.g.,
        
        		$ nts -v p | less
        
        
        * Session mode
        
            Use the `-s` argument to begin session mode:
        
        		$ nts -s
        
        	This begins a session in which data is loaded into memory and remains available for subsequent interaction. In this mode, *nts* assumes command of the terminal window and provides its own `>` command prompt. Then, e.g., entering `p` at the prompt
        
        		> p
        
        	would display the path view. Session mode adds several features not available in command mode. E.g., when there are more lines to display than will fit in the terminal window, the lines are divided into pages with up and down cursor keys used to change pages.
        
        #### Command Summary
        
        Action          | Command Mode | Session Mode | Notes
        ----------------|--------------|--------------|------
        help            |  -h          |  h or ?      |   ~
        begin session   |  -s          |  ~           |   ~
        end session     |    ~         |  q           |   ~
        path view       |  -v p        |  p           |   ~
        tags view       |  -v t        |  t           |   ~
        hide notes      | -n           |  n           |   1
        hide nodes      | -N           |  N           |   2
        set max levels  | -m MAX       |  m MAX       |   3
        highlight REGEX |              |  / REGEX     |   4
        find REGEX      | -f REGEX     |  f REGEX     |   5
        inspect IDENT   | -i IDENT     |  i IDENT     |   6
        back            |    ~         |  b           |   7
        edit IDENT      | -e IDENT     |  e IDENT     |   8
        add to IDENT    | -a IDENT     |  a IDENT     |   9
        update check    | -u           |  u           |  10
        
        1. Suppress showing notes in the outline. In session mode this toggles the display of notes off and on.
        2. Suppress showing nodes in the outline, i.e., display only the notes. In session mode this toggles the display of the nodes off and on.
        3. Limit the diplay of nodes in the outline to the integer MAX levels. Use MAX = 0 to display all levels.
        4. Highlight displayed lines that contain a match for the case-insensitive regular expression REGEX. Enter an empty REGEX to clear highlighting.
        5. Display complete notes that contain a match in the title, tags or body for the case-insensitive regular expression REGEX.
        6. If IDENT is the 2-number identifier for a note, then display the contents of that note. Else if IDENT is the identifier for a ".txt" file, then display the contents of that file. Otherwise limit the display to that part of the outline which starts from the corresponding node.
        7. In session mode, switch back and forth between the two most recent displays.
        8. If IDENT corresponds to either a note or a ".txt" file, then open that file for editing and, in the case of a note, scroll to the beginning line of the note.
        9. If IDENT corresponds to either a note or a ".txt" file, then open that file for appending a new note. Otherwise, if IDENT corresponds to a directory, then prompt for the name of a child to add to that node. If the name entered ends with ".txt", a new note file will be created and opened for editing. Otherwise, a new subdirectory will be added to the node directory using the name provided. Use "0" as the IDENT to add to the root (data) node.
        10. Compare the installed version of nts with the latest version on GitHub (requires internet connection) and report the result.
        
        
        ### Configuration
        
        Before you start *nts* for the first time, think about where you would like to keep your personal data files and any log files that _nts_ will create. This will be your nts _home directory_. The _nts_ configuration file, "cfg.yaml" will be placed in this directory as well as the data and log files in the subdirectories _data_ and _logs_, respectively.
        
        The default is to use whatever directory you're in when you start _nts_ as the _home directory_ either 1) if it is empty (unused so far) or 2) if it contains  subdirectories called "data" and "logs" (not empty and already in use for _nts_). To use this option just change to this directory before starting _nts_.
        
        Alternatively, if the current working directory doesn't satisfy the requirments but there is an environmental variable, `NTSHOME`, that contains the path to an existing directory, then *nts* will use this as its _home directory_. To use this option, first create the directory and then set the enivonmental variable by, e.g., appending the following to your "~/.bash_profile":
        
        		export NTSHOME="complete path to the nts home directory"
        
        Finally, if neither of the previous alternatives are satisfied, then *nts* will use "\~/nts" as its _home directory_, creating this directory if necessary.
        
        The _nts_ "data" and "logs" directories will be created if necessary. If "data" needs to be created, the user will additionally be offered the opportunity to populate it with the data for the grandchild.txt example discussed above.
        
        The _nts_ configuration file, "cfg.yaml" will also be created in this _home directory_. The default settings are for the editor _vim_.  If you prefer using another editor, you will need to edit this file and make the necessary changes. Here are the default contents of this file:
        
        
        	##################### IMPORTANT #############################
        	#
        	# Changes to this file only take effect when nts is restarted.
        	#
        	#############################################################
        	#
        	##################        EDIT      #########################
        	# The following are examples using the editor vim
        	# To use the native version of vim under Mac OSX, replace
        	# 'vim' with '/Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim'
        	# in each of the following commands.
        	#
        	# edit {filepath} at {linenum} - wait for completion
        	session_edit: vim -g -f +{linenum} {filepath}
        	#
        	# edit {filepath} at end of file - wait for completion
        	session_add: vim -g -f + {filepath}
        	#
        	# edit {filepath} at {linenum} - do not wait for completion
        	command_edit: vim -g +{linenum} {filepath}
        	#
        	# edit {filepath} at end of file - do not wait for completion
        	command_add: vim -g + {filepath}
        	#
        	##################        STYLE        ######################
        	# style hex colors for plain, prompt and highlight
        	style:
        		plain:        '#FFFAFA'
        		prompt:       '#FFF68F'
        		highlight:    'bg:#FFF68F #000000'
        
        
        ### Organizing with Paths and Tags
        
        Here are a few organizational ideas that have helped me. First, a reference section for all the stuff I want to remember, but usually can't:
        
                └── reference
                    ├── entertainment
                    │   ├── books.txt
                    │   ├── movies.txt
                    │   └── quotations.txt
                    └── programming
                        ├── markdown.txt
                        ├── python.txt
                        └── vim.txt
        
        Another example is a journal section for monthly notes
        
                └── journal
                    ├── 2021
                    │   ├── 10.txt
                    │   ├── 11.txt
                    │   └── 12.txt
                    └── 2022
                        ├── 01.txt
                        ├── 02.txt
                        └── 03.txt
        
        and one for my projects
        
                └── projects
                    ├── etm
                    │   ├── advocacy.txt
                    │   ├── bugs.txt
                    │   └── ideas.txt
                    └── nts
                        ├── advocacy.txt
                        ├── bugs.txt
                        └── ideas.txt
        
        
        For tags,  using the _GTD_ (Getting Things Done) classifiers is handy:
        
        now
        : action required as soon as possible
        
        next
        : action needed when time permits
        
        delegated joe
        : assigned to joe for action but follow up still required
        
        someday
        : review from time to time for possible action
        
        Better, if you use _!_ for _now_, _#_ for _next_, _%_ for _delegated_ and _>_ for _someday_, then these tags will always appear as the top branches in tag view because of the way these special characters are sorted.[^1]
        
        
        [^1]: This is python's _dictionary order_ for common keyboard characters:
        '!', '#', '$', '%', '&', '(', ')', '*', '+', '-', '/', '1', '2', '3', ';', '<', '=', '>', '?', '@', 'A', 'B', 'C', '[', ']', '^', '_', 'a', 'b', 'c', '{', '}', '~'
        
        One of the nice things about tags is that they are so easy to change. When you've taken care of a _now_ item, e.g., just remove the tag or change the tag to _\~_ for _completed_ and it will still appear in tags view but now at the bottom.
        
        Other ideas for tags from _GTD_ involve contexts such as _home_, _office_, _shop_, _phone_, _internet_, _driving_ and so forth.
        
        
        ### Installation
        
        #### For use in a virtual environment
        
        The steps for OS/X or linux are illustrated below. For details see [python-virtual-environments-a-primer](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Frealpython.com%2Fpython-virtual-environments-a-primer%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFh7QpJQ4rPCDjZ1eLrV1BRCCpSmw).
        
        Open a terminal and begin by creating a new directory/folder for the virtual environment, say `nts-pypi`, in your home directory:
        
        	$ mkdir ~/nts-pypi
        	$ cd ~/nts-pypi
        
        Now continue by creating the virtual environment (python >= 3.7.3 is required for nts):
        
        	$ python3 -m venv env
        
        After a few seconds you will have an `./env` directory. Now activate the virtual environment:
        
        	$ source env/bin/activate
        
        The prompt will now change to something containing `(env)` to indicate that the virtual environment is active. Updating pip is now recommended:
        
        	(env) $ pip install -U pip
        
        Note that this invokes `./env/bin/pip`. Once this is finished, use pip to install nts:
        
        	(env) $ pip install -U nts-dgraham
        
        This will install nts and all its requirements in
        
        	./env/lib/python3.x/sitepackages
        
        and will also install an executable called `nts` in `./env/bin`.You can then start nts using
        
        	(env) nts ARGS
        
        using ARGS enumerated in the **Command Summary** section above.
        
        
        #### For use system wide
        
        If your system allows you to run `sudo` and you want general access system wide, then you could instead install nts using
        
            $ sudo -H python3.x -m pip install -U nts-dgraham
        
        replacing the `3.x` with the verion of python you want to use, e.g., `3.7`. This would put nts in your path (in the bin directory for python3.7).
        
        
        You can then open a terminal and start nts using
        
            $ nts ARGS
        
        using ARGS enumerated in the **Command Summary** section above.

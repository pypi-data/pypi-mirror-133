# Annotation of Spoken Macedonian

## A simple morphological tagger for annotation of Macedonian written and spoken language data

This is a package for simple annotation of macedonian spoken (also dialectal) texts. 
The package uses the token-dictionary created during the development  
of the [Macedonian Spoken Corpus](https://escher.pythonanywhere.com/) 
and will annotate the tokens of your text if they are present in that dictionary.
See the list of the tags  [here](https://escher.pythonanywhere.com/tagset) .
The  dictionary is constantly being expanded in new releases of the tagger. 



The tagger is designed for smaller projects since it contains several 
limitations which would require a manual after-processing from the user. 
First, this concerns the processing homonyms.

## Dealing with homonyms
The tagger can not distinguish homonyms

* The word 'se' is always marked as a participle Q (tag for participle).
  You need to manually correct the cases where it stands for the third person plural for on the verb "to be" in presence
* The word 'si' is always marked as a participle P (tag for pronoun).
  You need to manually correct the cases where it stands for the second person singular for on the verb "to be" in presence
  
The annotation for homonyms can be either marked with the string "HOMONYM" or left empty in the output. 

## Dealing with unknown words

The annotation for unknown words can be either marked with the string "UNKNOWN" or left empty in the output. 

## Usage

###Installation

```shell
pip install spoken_macedonian_annotation
```
 In a code editor, you can annotate texts by passing the string to the ```annotate``` method of a ```MacAnnotator``` object:

```python
from spoken_macedonian_annotation.annotate import MacAnnotator

text = 'Ова е мојата куќа.'

annotator = MacAnnotator(print_to_txt_file=True, mark_homonyms=False, mark_unknown_tokens=False)
result = annotator.annotate(text)
print(result)
```
In command line, you can pass a file with a plain text  to the command line script ```annotateMac```: 

```shell
annotateMac -i your_text_to_annotate.txt --print_to_txt
```

The argument ``` --print_to_txt``` creates an output file in the working directory and writes the result in it. 

You can also use optional arguments for marking homonyms and/or unknown words:

```shell
annotateMac -i your_text_to_annotate.txt --print_to_txt --mark_homonyms --mark_unknown
```

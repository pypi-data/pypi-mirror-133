# pyxtend

Some functions to make Python more productive.

## TODO
* Add numpy to requirements
* Add rest of functions
* Update the __init__ or __all__ file so it can be imported with from pyxtend import struct
* Needs better performance on cases like np.zeros((10000, 2, 256, 256, 3))
** Should it only do the extra thing for sets?

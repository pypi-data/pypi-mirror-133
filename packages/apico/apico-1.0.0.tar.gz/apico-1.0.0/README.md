## Some reference
Below you'll find some insight that might not be instantly apparent.

### Events
The events supported by the `Monitor.listener` decorator are:
- `change`
- `request`
- `no_change`  

As you can see in the example, listeners can be registered by passing the event name straight to the decorator (`monitor.listener('change')`) or inferred from the function name starting with `on_`:
```py
@monitor.listener()
def on_change(...):
```

### Returns
The responses returned by apico are actually instances of [`requests.Response`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)

        *The easy way to monitor changes in RESTful APIs.*
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        $ pip install apico
        ```
        ## Example usage 
        ```py
        from apico import Monitor, Response
        
        
        monitor = Monitor(url='https://api.github.com/users/itsmewulf', rate=10.0, headers={'Authorization': 'GITHUB_TOKEN'})
        
        @monitor.listener()
        def on_change(old, new):
            print('Something changed!')
            
        @monitor.listener('no_change')
        def nothing_changed():
            print('Nothing changed!')
            
        @monitor.listener()
        def on_request():
            print('This is called before every request.')
        ```
        
        ## Some reference
        Below you'll find some insight that might not be instantly apparent.
        
        ### Events
        The events supported by the `Monitor.listener` decorator are:
        - `change`
        - `request`
        - `no_change`  
        
        As you can see in the example, listeners can be registered by passing the event name straight to the decorator (`monitor.listener('change')`) or inferred from the function name starting with `on_`:
        ```py
        @monitor.listener()
        def on_change(...):
        ```
        
        ### Returns
        The responses returned by apico are actually instances of [`requests.Response`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)

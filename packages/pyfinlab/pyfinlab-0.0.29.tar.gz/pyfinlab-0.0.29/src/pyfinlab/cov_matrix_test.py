"""
These functions are designed to test covariance risk models from the portfoliolab library on out-of-sample data. 
To demonstrate, price time series data is split into sub-samples and each risk model's covariance matrix of each 
sub-sample is compared to the empirical covariance matrix of the next sequential sub-sample. Forecast error is measured 
by the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) and averaged together for each risk model. The risk model with the lowest average
SSE is hypothetically the best risk model because it apparently had the lowest forecast error.

## ü§î About The Project

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->

This respository contains the sotware package and models described in the publication:

*A Machine Learning Classification Model for Monitoring the Daily Physical Behaviour of Lower-Limb Amputees" (currently under review)*.

The code works with data export from the activPAL activtiy monitor [palt.com](https://www.palt.com/)

Here are the main uses for this software:

* Estimate physical behaviour postures from shank accelerometer data
* Process shank accelerometer data along with thigh accelerometer event data to create a labeled dataset for training:
  * Machine learning classifiers from heuristic features
  * Deep learning classifiers from windowed acceleration data
* Re-create the model development process used in Griffiths et al. (2021)
* Experiment with new model development
* Estimate non-wear periods from accelerometer data

See the [example scripts](https://github.com/Ben-Jamin-Griff/ProsNet/tree/main/examples) for each of these use cases.

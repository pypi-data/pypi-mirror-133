Keep track of leads, staff, work orders, and a gallery of images for each work order

* Leads hold client contact information and can have any number of associated work orders
* Work orders can have any number of associated images and assigned staff members
* Staff members are assigned groups based on their role and have permissions based on their group
* Staff members can be assigned to work orders, cancel or submit completed work orders, upload images, etc.

Please see the roadmap below for features currently under development.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You can install this project using **pip** or by cloning the github repository

### Prerequisites

If you already have a virtual environment and django project set up, you can skip ahead to the next step.

1. Start a new virtual environment in your project directory or wherever you keep them
  ```sh
  $ python3 -m venv env
  ```

2. Activate your virtual environment
  ```sh
  $ source /path/to/env/bin/activate
  ```

3. Inside of your environment, install Django and start a new project
```sh
  $ pip install django
  $ django-admin startproject steamcleancrm
```

### Install using pip

Take a look at the prerequisites for instructions on setting up your virtual environment and django project if you haven't already

* Inside of your environment, run the command to install the package with pip
  ```sh
  $ pip install django-steamcleancrm==0.1
  ```

* Add the package to the Installed Apps section of your settings.py file
  ```sh
  INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...

    'crm.aps.CrmConfig'
  ]
  ```

### Cloning the github repo

1. Activate your virtual environment and navigate to the directory you want to clone the project in

2. Clone the repo
  ```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/JohnGWebDev/steamcleaning.git
  ```

3. Install the project dependencies from .requirements
  ```sh
  $ pip install -r .requirements
  ```

4. Create a .env file in the project's root directory for your environment variables

5. Generate a new secret key for your django settings with the following command
  ```sh
  $ python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe())"
  ```

6. Copy the new token and paste it into your .env file, for example:
  ```sh
  SECRET_KEY=OZvhK2ApBiLy4uXf91MIm2RNDK3b2dDp0UV7gAL0tBM
  ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The project requirements were a lightweight client relationship management tool that can also store any number of images associated with a specific work order with room for future development.

### Groups and Permissions

There are three groups a staff member can be assigned to:

  * Representative
      * Create and update leads
      * Create, update and cancel work orders
  * Technician
      * Create and update leads
      * Create, update, cancel and complete work orders
      * Upload and delete images
  * Manager
      * Create and update leads
      * Create, update, and approve canceled/completed work orders
      * Upload and delete images
      * Assign technicians to work orders

### Data Pipeline

1. Add a lead manually
    - Leads can be added manually by a representative from incoming calls or automatically from a cross-origin POST request such as a contact form
    - Stores client contact information
    - Leads can have any number of related work orders

2. Open a work order relating to the lead
    - Stores description of the work to be perform, appointment dates, assigned Technicians, associated images, estimated total, etc.

3. Manager or Admin assigns a technician to the work order
    - Any number of Technicians can be assigned to a work order

4. Work is performed
    - Technicians can update work orders if needed on the job

5. Technician uploads images to work order and marks it complete
    - Any number of images can be uploaded to a work order
    - A work order can also be canceled at any time
    - When a Technician marks a work order canceled or complete, it is submitted for review by a Manager or Admin

6. Automated email survey ( under development )
    - Survey is sent to client one work order is verified complete by a Manager/Admin
    - Technicians also fill out a survey after completing each work order

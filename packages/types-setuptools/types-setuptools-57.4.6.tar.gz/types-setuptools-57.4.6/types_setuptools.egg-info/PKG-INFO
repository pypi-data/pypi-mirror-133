## Typing stubs for setuptools

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `setuptools` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `setuptools`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/setuptools. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `032e6ee90cbb938259a2aa2183966502de19108e`.

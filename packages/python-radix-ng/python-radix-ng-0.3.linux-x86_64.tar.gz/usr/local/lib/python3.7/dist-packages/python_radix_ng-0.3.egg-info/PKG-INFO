Description: python-radix library
        ====================
        
        The library contains tools for representing natural numbers in a given base,
        or to current any numeral representing a natural number between two bases.
        Currently any base between 2 and 36 is supported.
        
        
        
        Python-radix usage examples
        ---------------------------
        Python-radix has both procedural and object-oriented solutions.
        
        ### Procedural way example
        
            # to convert numeral 4 from base 10 to base 2
            >>> cast('4', 10, 2)
            '100'
        
            # to convert the integer 4 to base 2
            >>> cast(4, None, 2)
        
        Note that since the first argument is a number, rather than a numeral,
        the second parameter is irrelevant, so None is used.
        
        ### Object oriented way example
            >>> # create an object to find the base 2 representation of any natural number
            >>> new = Converter(None, 2)
            >>> new.convert(4)
            '100'
            >>> # create an object to find the base 2 representation of any base 10 numeral
            >>> new = Converter(10, 2)
        
            >>> new.convert('4')
            '100'
        
        **Using characters as digits**
        
            # the digits 0 through 9 are succeeded by the lower case ASCII alphabet
            >>> cast('a', 16, 10)
            '10'

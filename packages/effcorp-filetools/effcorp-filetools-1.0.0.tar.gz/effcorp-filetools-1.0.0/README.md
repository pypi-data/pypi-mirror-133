# Efficient Corporates File Tools Utilities in Python
First of all, Welcome to Efficient Corporates..! 
Before you start reading the Documentation, let us please give you a small Disclaimer


*At, Efficient Corporates (or Eff Corp as we call it), we believe that Coding is for everyone and 
everyone has the right to make their life simpler through use of automation.
Hence, we endeavor to make it simpler for non coders (like the people without Computer Science as their Major
even Commerce / Arts  background people)to make coding a daily habit . Since,
we believe on making things less technical and more practial, hence, it is possible that 
we may not follow the best coding practices or documentation practice to ensure that 
users get to understand easily , So.. PLEASE EXCUSE US  for that*

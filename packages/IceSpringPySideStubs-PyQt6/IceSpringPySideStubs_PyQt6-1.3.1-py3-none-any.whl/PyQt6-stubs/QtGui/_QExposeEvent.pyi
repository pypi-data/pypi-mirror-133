    **Detailed Description**

    Expose events are sent to windows when they move between the un-exposed and
    exposed states.

    An exposed window is potentially visible to the user. If the window is moved
    off screen, is made totally obscured by another window, is minimized, or
    similar, an expose event is sent to the window, and isExposed() might change
    to false.

    Expose events should not be used to paint. Handle **QPaintEvent**  instead.

    The event handler **QWindow::exposeEvent** () receives expose events.

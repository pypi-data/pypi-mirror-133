        iterations , quint64 dkLen )**

        Derive a key using the PBKDF2-algorithm as defined in **RFC 8018,
        section 5.2** .

        This function takes the **data** and **salt** , and then applies HMAC-X,
        where the X is **algorithm** , repeatedly. It internally concatenates
        intermediate results to the final output until at least **dkLen** amount
        of bytes have been computed and it will execute HMAC-X **iterations**
        times each time a concatenation is required. The total number of times
        it will execute HMAC-X depends on **iterations** , **dkLen** and
        **algorithm** and can be calculated as `iterations * ceil(dkLen /
        QCryptographicHash::hashLength(algorithm))`.

        This function was introduced in Qt 5.12.

        **See also** **deriveKeyPbkdf1** , **QMessageAuthenticationCode** , and
        **QCryptographicHash** .

        Returns a hash computed using the PBKDF1-algorithm as defined in **RFC
        8018, section 5.1** .

        The function takes the **data** and **salt** , and then hashes it
        repeatedly for **iterations** iterations using the specified hash
        **algorithm**. If the resulting hash is longer than **dkLen** then it is
        truncated before it is returned.

        This function only supports SHA-1 and MD5! The max output size is 160
        bits (20 bytes) when using SHA-1, or 128 bits (16 bytes) when using MD5.
        Specifying a value for **dkLen** which is greater than this results in a
        warning and an empty **QByteArray**  is returned. To programmatically
        check this limit you can use **QCryptographicHash::hashLength** .
        Furthermore: the **salt** must always be 8 bytes long!

        **Note:** This function is provided for use with legacy applications and
        all new applications are recommended to use **PBKDF2** .

        This function was introduced in Qt 5.12.

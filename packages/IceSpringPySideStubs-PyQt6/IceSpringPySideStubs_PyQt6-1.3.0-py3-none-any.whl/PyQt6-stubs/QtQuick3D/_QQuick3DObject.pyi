    **Detailed Description**

    **Object3D**  is the base class for all Qt Quick 3D scene objects. Currently
    the types available in C++ are:

    * **QQuick3DGeometry**
      * **QQuick3DTextureData**

    Both of these types are resource objects which directly inherit
    QQuick3DObject.

    It should not be necessary to use QQuick3DObject directly anywhere currently
    because it is just an interface for supporting spatial items and resources
    in a 3D scene, as well as exposing similar functionality as **QQuickItem**
    for 3D scene content.

        This property holds the name of the current state of the object.

        If the item is in its default state, that is, no explicit state has been
        set, then this property holds an empty string. Likewise, you can return
        an item to its default state by setting this property to an empty
        string.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

```bash
pip install pyhelpers
```

**Note:**

- Only a few frequently-used dependencies are installed through `pip install`. 
- When importing the module/functions whose dependencies are not available with the installation (or if you happen not to have those dependencies installed yet), an "*ModuleNotFoundError*" will be prompted and you may install them separately.

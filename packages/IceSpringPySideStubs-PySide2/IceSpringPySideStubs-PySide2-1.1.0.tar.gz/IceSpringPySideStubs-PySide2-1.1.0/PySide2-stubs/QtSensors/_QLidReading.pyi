    **Detailed Description**

    A normal laptop has what we call a front lid.

    If the laptop can be converted to a tablet by rotating or closing the lid
    where the display is out, this is known as a back lid.

    **QLidReading Units**

    The Lid sensor can detect if a device's lid is closed or not. A lid can be a
    laptop, a laptop that converts to a tablet, or even a cover for a tablet or
    phone.

        **backLidClosed : const bool**

        This property holds a value indicating whether the back lid is closed. A
        back lid can be when a convertable laptop is closed into to tablet mode
        without keyboard.

    **Detailed Description**

    Before the search engine can be used, one has to instantiate at least a
    **QHelpEngineCore**  object that needs to be passed to the search engines
    constructor. This is required as the search engine needs to be connected to
    the help engines setupFinished() signal to know when it can start to index
    documentation.

    After starting the indexing process the signal **indexingStarted** () is
    emitted and on the end of the indexing process the **indexingFinished** ()
    is emitted. To stop the indexing one can call **cancelIndexing** ().

    When the indexing process has finished, the search engine can be used to
    search through the index for a given term using the search() function. When
    the search input is passed to the search engine, the **searchingStarted** ()
    signal is emitted. When the search finishes, the **searchingFinished** ()
    signal is emitted. The search process can be stopped by calling
    **cancelSearching** ().

    If the search succeeds, **searchingFinished** () is called with the search
    result count to fetch the search results from the search engine. Calling the
    **searchResults** () function with a range returns a list of
    **QHelpSearchResult**  objects within the range. The results consist of the
    document title and URL, as well as a snippet from the document that contains
    the best match for the search input.

    To display the given search results use the **QHelpSearchResultWidget**  or
    build up your own one if you need more advanced functionality. Note that the
    **QHelpSearchResultWidget**  can not be instantiated directly, you must
    retrieve the widget from the search engine in use as all connections will be
    established for you by the widget itself.

        Starts the search process using the given search phrase **searchInput**.

        The phrase may consist of several words. By default, the search engine
        returns the list of documents that contain all the specified words. The
        phrase may contain any combination of the logical operators AND, OR, and
        NOT. The operator must be written in all capital letters, otherwise it
        will be considered a part of the search phrase.

        If double quotation marks are used to group the words, the search engine
        will search for an exact match of the quoted phrase.

        For more information about the text query syntax, see **SQLite FTS5
        Extension** .

        This function was introduced in Qt 5.9.

    **Detailed Description**

    Rich content such as **images** , **reviews**  and **editorials**  inherit
    from the QPlaceContent class which contains common properties such as an
    attribution string and content contributor, which may take the form of a
    **user**  and/or **supplier** . It is possible that a user from a supplier
    is contributing content, hence both fields could be filled in
    simultaneously.

    **Note:** Some providers may **require** that the attribution string be
    displayed to the user whenever a piece of content is viewed.

    Conversion between QPlaceContent and it's subclasses can be easily performed
    without casting. Due to the way it has been implemented, object slicing is
    not an issue, the following code is valid:

    **QPlaceImage**  image;
        image.setUrl(**QUrl** ("www.example.com"));
    **QPlaceContent**  content = image;

        **QPlaceImage**  image2;
    image2 = content;
        **qDebug** () << image2.url(); //image2.url() ==
    "www.example.com"

    The rich content of a place is typically made available as paginated items.
    The ability to convert between QPlaceContent and it's subclasses means that
    code which handles the mechanics of paging can be easily shared for each of
    the sub types.

    At present the QPlaceContent class is not extensible by 3rd parties.

    Note: The Places API considers content objects to be 'retrieve-only'
    objects. Submission of content to a provider is not a supported use case.

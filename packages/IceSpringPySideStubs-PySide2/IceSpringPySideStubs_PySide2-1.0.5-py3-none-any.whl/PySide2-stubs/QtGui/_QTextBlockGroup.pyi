    **Detailed Description**

    Block groups can be used to organize blocks of text within a document. They
    maintain an up-to-date list of the text blocks that belong to them, even
    when text blocks are being edited.

    Each group has a parent document which is specified when the group is
    constructed.

    Text blocks can be inserted into a group with **blockInserted** (), and
    removed with **blockRemoved** (). If a block's format is changed,
    **blockFormatChanged** () is called.

    The list of blocks in the group is returned by **blockList** (). Note that
    the blocks in the list are not necessarily adjacent elements in the
    document; for example, the top-level items in a multi-level list will be
    separated by the items in lower levels of the list.

    **See also** **QTextBlock**  and **QTextDocument** .

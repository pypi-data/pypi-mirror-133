    **Detailed Description**

    The QOpenGLTimeMonitor class is a convenience wrapper around a collection of
    OpenGL timer query objects used to measure intervals of time on the GPU to
    the level of granularity required by your rendering application.

    The OpenGL timer queries objects are queried in sequence to record the GPU
    timestamps at positions of interest in your rendering code. Once the results
    for all issues timer queries become available, the results can be fetched
    and QOpenGLTimerMonitor will calculate the recorded time intervals for you.

    The typical use case of this class is to either profile your application's
    rendering algorithms or to adjust those algorithms in real-time for dynamic
    performance/quality balancing.

    Prior to using QOpenGLTimeMonitor in your rendering function you should set
    the required number of sample points that you wish to record by calling
    setSamples(). Note that measuring N sample points will produce N-1 time
    intervals. Once you have set the number of sample points, call the
    **create** () function with a valid current OpenGL context to create the
    necessary query timer objects. These steps are usually performed just once
    in an initialization function.

    Use the **recordSample** () function to delimit blocks of code containing
    OpenGL commands that you wish to time. You can check availability of the
    resulting time samples and time intervals with **isResultAvailable** (). The
    calculated time intervals and the raw timestamp samples can be retrieved
    with the blocking **waitForIntervals** () and **waitForSamples** ()
    functions respectively.

    After retrieving the results and before starting a new round of taking
    samples (for example, in the next frame) be sure to call the **reset** ()
    function which will clear the cached results and reset the timer index back
    to the first timer object.

        If this returns `true` and the associated OpenGL context is current,
        then you are able to record time samples with this object.

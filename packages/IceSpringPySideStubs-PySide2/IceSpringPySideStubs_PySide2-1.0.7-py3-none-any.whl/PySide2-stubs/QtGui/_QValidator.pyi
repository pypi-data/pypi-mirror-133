    https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qvalidator.html

    **Detailed Description**

    The class itself is abstract. Two subclasses, **QIntValidator**  and
    **QDoubleValidator** , provide basic numeric-range checking, and
    **QRegExpValidator**  provides general checking using a custom regular
    expression.

    If the built-in validators aren\'t sufficient, you can subclass QValidator.
    The class has two virtual functions: **validate** () and **fixup** ().

    **validate** () must be implemented by every subclass. It returns
    **Invalid** , **Intermediate**  or **Acceptable**  depending on whether its
    argument is valid (for the subclass\'s definition of valid).

    These three states require some explanation. An **Invalid**  string is
    **clearly** invalid. **Intermediate**  is less obvious: the concept of
    validity is difficult to apply when the string is incomplete (still being
    edited). QValidator defines **Intermediate**  as the property of a string
    that is neither clearly invalid nor acceptable as a final result.
    **Acceptable**  means that the string is acceptable as a final result. One
    might say that any string that is a plausible intermediate state during
    entry of an **Acceptable**  string is **Intermediate** .

    Here are some examples:

    * For a line edit that accepts integers from 10 to 1000 inclusive, 42 and
    123 are **Acceptable** , the empty string and 5 are **Intermediate** , and
    "asdf" and 1114 is **Invalid** .
      * For an editable combobox that accepts
    URLs, any well-formed URL is **Acceptable** , "http://example.com/," is
    **Intermediate**  (it might be a cut and paste action that accidentally took
    in a comma at the end), the empty string is **Intermediate**  (the user
    might select and delete all of the text in preparation for entering a new
    URL) and "http:///./" is **Invalid** .
      * For a spin box that accepts
    lengths, "11cm" and "1in" are **Acceptable** , "11" and the empty string are
    **Intermediate** , and "http://example.com" and "hour" are **Invalid** .

    **fixup** () is provided for validators that can repair some user errors.
    The default implementation does nothing. **QLineEdit** , for example, will
    call **fixup** () if the user presses Enter (or Return) and the content is
    not currently valid. This allows the **fixup** () function the opportunity
    of performing some magic to make an **Invalid**  string **Acceptable** .

    A validator has a locale, set with **setLocale** (). It is typically used to
    parse localized data. For example, **QIntValidator**  and
    **QDoubleValidator**  use it to parse localized representations of integers
    and doubles.

    QValidator is typically used with **QLineEdit** , **QSpinBox**  and
    **QComboBox** .

    **See also** **QIntValidator** , **QDoubleValidator** , **QRegExpValidator**
    , and **Line Edits Example** .

        **[virtual] void QValidator::fixup(QString & input ) const**

        This function attempts to change **input** to be valid according to this
        validator\'s rules. It need not result in a valid string: callers of this
        function must re-test afterwards; the default does nothing.

        Reimplementations of this function can change **input** even if they do
        not produce a valid string. For example, an ISBN validator might want to
        delete every character except digits and "-", even if the result is
        still not a valid ISBN; a surname validator might want to remove
        whitespace from the start and end of the string, even if the resulting
        string is not in the list of accepted surnames.

        Sets the **locale** that will be used for the validator. Unless
        setLocale has been called, the validator will use the default locale set
        with **QLocale::setDefault** (). If a default locale has not been set,
        it is the operating system's locale.

        This virtual function returns **Invalid**  if **input** is invalid
        according to this validator\'s rules, **Intermediate**  if it is likely
        that a little more editing will make the input acceptable (e.g. the user
        types "4" into a widget which accepts integers between 10 and 99), and
        **Acceptable**  if the input is valid.

        The function can change both **input** and **pos** (the cursor position)
        if required.

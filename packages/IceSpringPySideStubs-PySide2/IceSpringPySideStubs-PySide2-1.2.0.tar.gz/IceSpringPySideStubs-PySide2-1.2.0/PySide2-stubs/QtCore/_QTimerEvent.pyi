    **Detailed Description**

    Timer events are sent at regular intervals to objects that have started one
    or more timers. Each timer has a unique identifier. A timer is started with
    **QObject::startTimer** ().

    The **QTimer**  class provides a high-level programming interface that uses
    signals instead of events. It also provides single-shot timers.

    The event handler **QObject::timerEvent** () receives timer events.

    **See also** **QTimer** , **QObject::timerEvent** (),
    **QObject::startTimer** (), and **QObject::killTimer** ().

        **QTimerEvent::QTimerEvent(int timerId )**

        Constructs a timer event object with the timer identifier set to
        **timerId**.

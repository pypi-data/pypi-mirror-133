        Sets up an OpenGL Context that can be shared between threads. This has
        to be done before **QGuiApplication**  is created and before window's
        QPlatformOpenGLContext is created.

        This has the same effect as setting the **Qt::AA_ShareOpenGLContexts**
        attribute with **QCoreApplication::setAttribute**  before constructing
        **QGuiApplication** .

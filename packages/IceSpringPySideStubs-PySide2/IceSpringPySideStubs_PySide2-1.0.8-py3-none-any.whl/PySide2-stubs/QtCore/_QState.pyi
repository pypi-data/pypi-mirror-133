    **Detailed Description**

    QState objects can have child states, and can have transitions to other
    states. QState is part of **The State Machine Framework** .

    The **addTransition** () function adds a transition. The
    **removeTransition** () function removes a transition. The **transitions**
    () function returns the state's outgoing transitions.

    The **assignProperty** () function is used for defining property assignments
    that should be performed when a state is entered.

    Top-level states must be passed a **QStateMachine**  object as their parent
    state, or added to a state machine using **QStateMachine::addState** ().

    **States with Child States**

    The **childMode**  property determines how child states are treated. For
    non-parallel state groups, the **setInitialState** () function must be
    called to set the initial state. The child states are mutually exclusive
    states, and the state machine needs to know which child state to enter when
    the parent state is the target of a transition.

    The state emits the **QState::finished** () signal when a final child state
    (**QFinalState** ) is entered.

    The **setErrorState** () sets the state's error state. The error state is
    the state that the state machine will transition to if an error is detected
    when attempting to enter the state (e.g. because no initial state has been
    set).

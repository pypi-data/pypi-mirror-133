    **Detailed Description**

    Key events are sent to the widget with keyboard input focus when keys are
    pressed or released.

    A key event contains a special accept flag that indicates whether the
    receiver will handle the key event. This flag is set by default for
    **QEvent::KeyPress**  and **QEvent::KeyRelease** , so there is no need to
    call **accept** () when acting on a key event. For
    **QEvent::ShortcutOverride**  the receiver needs to explicitly accept the
    event to trigger the override. Calling **ignore** () on a key event will
    propagate it to the parent widget. The event is propagated up the parent
    widget chain until a widget accepts it or an event filter consumes it.

    The **QWidget::setEnabled** () function can be used to enable or disable
    mouse and keyboard events for a widget.

    The event handlers **QWidget::keyPressEvent** (),
    **QWidget::keyReleaseEvent** (), **QGraphicsItem::keyPressEvent** () and
    **QGraphicsItem::keyReleaseEvent** () receive key events.

    **See also** **QFocusEvent**  and **QWidget::grabKeyboard** ().

        See **Qt::Key**  for the list of keyboard codes. These codes are
        independent of the underlying window system. Note that this function
        does not distinguish between capital and non-capital letters, use the
        **text** () function (returning the Unicode text the key generated) for
        this purpose.

        A value of either 0 or **Qt::Key_unknown**  means that the event is not
        the result of a known key; for example, it may be the result of a
        compose sequence, a keyboard macro, or due to key event compression.

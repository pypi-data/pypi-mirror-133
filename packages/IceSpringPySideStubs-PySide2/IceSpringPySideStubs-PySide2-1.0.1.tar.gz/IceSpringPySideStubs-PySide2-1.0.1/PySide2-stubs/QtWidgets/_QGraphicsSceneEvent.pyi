class QGraphicsSceneEvent(PySide2.QtCore.QEvent):
    """
    **Detailed Description**

    When a **QGraphicsView**  receives Qt mouse, keyboard, and drag and drop events (**QMouseEvent** , **QKeyEvent** , QDragEvent, etc.), it translates them into instances of QGraphicsSceneEvent subclasses and forwards them to the **QGraphicsScene**  it displays. The scene then forwards the events to the relevant items.

    For example, when a **QGraphicsView**  receives a **QMouseEvent**  of type MousePress as a response to a user click, the view sends a **QGraphicsSceneMouseEvent**  of type **GraphicsSceneMousePress**  to the underlying **QGraphicsScene**  through its **mousePressEvent()**  function. The default **QGraphicsScene::mousePressEvent** () implementation determines which item was clicked and forwards the event to **QGraphicsItem::mousePressEvent** ().

    Subclasses such as **QGraphicsSceneMouseEvent**  and **QGraphicsSceneContextMenuEvent**  provide the coordinates from the original **QEvent**  in screen, scene, and item coordinates (see **screenPos()** , **scenePos()** , and **pos()** ). The item coordinates are set by the **QGraphicsScene**  before it forwards the event to the event to a **QGraphicsItem** . The mouse events also add the possibility to retrieve the coordinates from the last event received by the view (see **lastScreenPos()** , **lastScenePos()** , and **lastPos()** ).

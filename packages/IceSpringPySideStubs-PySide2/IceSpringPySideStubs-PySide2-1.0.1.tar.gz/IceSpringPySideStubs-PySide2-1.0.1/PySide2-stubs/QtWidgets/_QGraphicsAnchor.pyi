    """
    **Detailed Description**

    The graphics anchor provides an API that enables you to query and manipulate the properties an anchor has. When an anchor is added to the layout with **QGraphicsAnchorLayout::addAnchor** (), a QGraphicsAnchor instance is returned where the properties are initialized to their default values. The properties can then be further changed, and they will be picked up the next time the layout is activated.

    **See also** **QGraphicsAnchorLayout::anchor** ().

    def setSizePolicy(self, policy: PySide2.QtWidgets.QSizePolicy.Policy) -> None:
        """
        **sizePolicy : QSizePolicy::Policy**

        This property holds the size policy for the **QGraphicsAnchor** .

        By setting the size policy on an anchor you can configure how the anchor can resize itself from its preferred spacing. For instance, if the anchor has the size policy **QSizePolicy::Minimum** , the spacing is the minimum size of the anchor. However, its size can grow up to the anchors maximum size. If the default size policy is **QSizePolicy::Fixed** , the anchor can neither grow or shrink, which means that the only size the anchor can have is the spacing. **QSizePolicy::Fixed**  is the default size policy. **QGraphicsAnchor**  always has a minimum spacing of 0 and a very large maximum spacing.

        **Access functions:**

        QSizePolicy::Policy **sizePolicy** () const
        void **setSizePolicy** (QSizePolicy::Policy **policy** )

        **See also** **QGraphicsAnchor::spacing** .

    def setSpacing(self, spacing: float) -> None:
        """
        **spacing : qreal**

        This property holds the preferred space between items in the **QGraphicsAnchorLayout** .

        Depending on the anchor type, the default spacing is either 0 or a value returned from the style.

        **Access functions:**

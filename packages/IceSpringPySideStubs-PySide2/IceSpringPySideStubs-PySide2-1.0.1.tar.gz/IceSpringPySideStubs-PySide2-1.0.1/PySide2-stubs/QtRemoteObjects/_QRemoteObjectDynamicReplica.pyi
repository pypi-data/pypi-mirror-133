    """
    **Detailed Description**

    There are generated replicas (replicas having the header files produced by the **Replica Compiler** ), and dynamic replicas, which are generated on-the-fly. This is the class for the dynamic type of replica.

    When the connection to the **Source**  object is made, the initialization step passes the current property values (see **Replica Initialization** ). In a DynamicReplica, the property/signal/slot details are also sent, allowing the replica object to be created on-the-fly. This can be conventient in QML or scripting, but has two primary disadvantages. First, the object is in effect "empty" until it is successfully initialized by the **Source** . Second, in C++, calls must be made using **QMetaObject::invokeMethod** (), as the moc generated lookup will not be available.

    This class does not have a public constructor. It can only be instantiated by using the dynamic **QRemoteObjectNode::acquire**  method.

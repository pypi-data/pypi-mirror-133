    """
    https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qjsengine.html

    **Detailed Description**

    **Evaluating Scripts**

    Use **evaluate** () to evaluate script code.

    **QJSEngine**  myEngine;
        **QJSValue**  three = myEngine.evaluate("1 + 2");

    **evaluate** () returns a **QJSValue**  that holds the result of the evaluation. The **QJSValue**  class provides functions for converting the result to various C++ types (e.g. **QJSValue::toString** () and **QJSValue::toNumber** ()).

    The following code snippet shows how a script function can be defined and then invoked from C++ using **QJSValue::call** ():

    **QJSValue**  fun = myEngine.evaluate("(function(a, b) { return a + b; })");
        **QJSValueList**  args;
        args << 1 << 2;
        **QJSValue**  threeAgain = fun.call(args);

    As can be seen from the above snippets, a script is provided to the engine in the form of a string. One common way of loading scripts is by reading the contents of a file and passing it to **evaluate** ():

    **QString**  fileName = "helloworld.qs";
        **QFile**  scriptFile(fileName);
        if (!scriptFile.open(**QIODevice** ::ReadOnly))
            // handle error
        **QTextStream**  stream(&scriptFile);
        **QString**  contents = stream.readAll();
        scriptFile.close();
        myEngine.evaluate(contents, fileName);

    Here we pass the name of the file as the second argument to **evaluate** (). This does not affect evaluation in any way; the second argument is a general-purpose string that is stored in the `Error` object for debugging purposes.

    For larger pieces of functionality, you may want to encapsulate your code and data into modules. A module is a file that contains script code, variables, etc., and uses export statements to describe its interface towards the rest of the application. With the help of import statements, a module can refer to functionality from other modules. This allows building a scripted application from smaller connected building blocks in a safe way. In contrast, the approach of using **evaluate** () carries the risk that internal variables or functions from one **evaluate** () call accidentally pollute the global object and affect subsequent evaluations.

    The following example provides a module that can add numbers:

    export function sum(left, right)
        {
            return left + right
        }

    This module can be loaded with QJSEngine::import() if it is saved under the name `math.mjs`:

    QJSvalue module = myEngine.importModule("./math.mjs");
        **QJSValue**  sumFunction = module.property("sum");
        **QJSValue**  result = sumFunction.call(args);

    Modules can also use functionality from other modules using import statements:

    import { sum } from "./math.mjs";
        export function addTwice(left, right)
        {
            return sum(left, right) * 2;
        }

    **Engine Configuration**

    The **globalObject** () function returns the **Global Object** associated with the script engine. Properties of the Global Object are accessible from any script code (i.e. they are global variables). Typically, before evaluating "user" scripts, you will want to configure a script engine by adding one or more properties to the Global Object:

    myEngine.globalObject().setProperty("myNumber", 123);
        ...
        **QJSValue**  myNumberPlusOne = myEngine.evaluate("myNumber + 1");

    Adding custom properties to the scripting environment is one of the standard means of providing a scripting API that is specific to your application. Usually these custom properties are objects created by the **newQObject** () or **newObject** () functions.

    **Script Exceptions**

    **evaluate** () can throw a script exception (e.g. due to a syntax error). If it does, then **evaluate** () returns the value that was thrown (typically an `Error` object). Use **QJSValue::isError** () to check for exceptions.

    For detailed information about the error, use **QJSValue::toString** () to obtain an error message, and use **QJSValue::property** () to query the properties of the `Error` object. The following properties are available:

    * `name`
      * `message`
      * `fileName`
      * `lineNumber`
      * `stack`

    **QJSValue**  result = myEngine.evaluate(...);
        if (result.isError())
            **qDebug** ()
                    << "Uncaught exception at line"
                    << result.property("lineNumber").toInt()
                    << ":" << result.toString();

    **Script Object Creation**

    Use **newObject** () to create a JavaScript object; this is the C++ equivalent of the script statement `new Object()`. You can use the object-specific functionality in **QJSValue**  to manipulate the script object (e.g. **QJSValue::setProperty** ()). Similarly, use **newArray** () to create a JavaScript array object.

    **QObject Integration**

    Use **newQObject** () to wrap a **QObject**  (or subclass) pointer. **newQObject** () returns a proxy script object; properties, children, and signals and slots of the **QObject**  are available as properties of the proxy object. No binding code is needed because it is done dynamically using the Qt meta object system.

    **QPushButton**  *button = new **QPushButton** ;
        **QJSValue**  scriptButton = myEngine.newQObject(button);
        myEngine.globalObject().setProperty("button", scriptButton);

        myEngine.evaluate("button.checkable = true");

        **qDebug** () << scriptButton.property("checkable").toBool();
        scriptButton.property("show").call(); // call the show() slot

    Use **newQMetaObject** () to wrap a **QMetaObject** ; this gives you a "script representation" of a **QObject** -based class. **newQMetaObject** () returns a proxy script object; enum values of the class are available as properties of the proxy object.

    Constructors exposed to the meta-object system (using **Q_INVOKABLE** ) can be called from the script to create a new **QObject**  instance with JavaScriptOwnership. For example, given the following class definition:

    class MyObject : public **QObject**
        {
            Q_OBJECT

        public:
            Q_INVOKABLE MyObject() {}
        };

    The `staticMetaObject` for the class can be exposed to JavaScript like so:

    **QJSValue**  jsMetaObject = engine.newQMetaObject(&MyObject::staticMetaObject);
        engine.globalObject().setProperty("MyObject", jsMetaObject);

    Instances of the class can then be created in JavaScript:

    engine.evaluate("var myObject = new MyObject()");

    **Note:** Currently only classes using the **Q_OBJECT**  macro are supported; it is not possible to expose the `staticMetaObject` of a **Q_GADGET**  class to JavaScript.

    **Dynamic QObject Properties**

    Dynamic **QObject**  properties are not supported. For example, the following code will not work:

    **QJSEngine**  engine;

        **QObject**  *myQObject = new **QObject** ();
        myQObject->setProperty("dynamicProperty", 3);

        **QJSValue**  myScriptQObject = engine.newQObject(myQObject);
        engine.globalObject().setProperty("myObject", myScriptQObject);

        **qDebug** () << engine.evaluate("myObject.dynamicProperty").toInt();

    **Extensions**

    QJSEngine provides a compliant ECMAScript implementation. By default, familiar utilities like logging are not available, but they can can be installed via the **installExtensions** () function.

        **void QJSEngine::collectGarbage()**

        Runs the garbage collector.

        The garbage collector will attempt to reclaim memory by locating and disposing of objects that are no longer reachable in the script environment.

        Normally you don't need to call this function; the garbage collector will automatically be invoked when the **QJSEngine**  decides that it's wise to do so (i.e. when a certain number of new objects have been created). However, you can call this function to explicitly request that garbage collection should be performed as soon as possible.

        **QJSValue QJSEngine::evaluate(const QString & program , const QString & fileName = QString(), int lineNumber = 1)**

        Evaluates **program** , using **lineNumber** as the base line number, and returns the result of the evaluation.

        The script code will be evaluated in the context of the global object.

        The evaluation of **program** can cause an **exception**  in the engine; in this case the return value will be the exception that was thrown (typically an `Error` object; see **QJSValue::isError** ()).

        **lineNumber** is used to specify a starting line number for **program** ; line number information reported by the engine that pertains to this evaluation will be based on this argument. For example, if **program** consists of two lines of code, and the statement on the second line causes a script exception, the exception line number would be **lineNumber** plus one. When no starting line number is specified, line numbers will be 1-based.

        **fileName** is used for error reporting. For example, in error objects the file name is accessible through the "fileName" property if it is provided with this function.

        **Note:** If an exception was thrown and the exception value is not an Error instance (i.e., **QJSValue::isError** () returns `false`), the exception value will still be returned, but there is currently no API for detecting that an exception did occur in this case.

        By default, the Global Object contains the built-in objects that are part of **ECMA-262** , such as Math, Date and String. Additionally, you can set properties of the Global Object to make your own extensions available to all script code. Non-local variables in script code will be created as properties of the Global Object, as well as local variables in global code.

        **QJSValue QJSEngine::importModule(const QString & fileName )**

        Imports the module located at **fileName** and returns a module namespace object that contains all exported variables, constants and functions as properties.

        If this is the first time the module is imported in the engine, the file is loaded from the specified location in either the local file system or the Qt resource system and evaluated as an ECMAScript module. The file is expected to be encoded in UTF-8 text.

        Subsequent imports of the same module will return the previously imported instance. Modules are singletons and remain around until the engine is destroyed.

        The specified **fileName** will internally be normalized using **QFileInfo::canonicalFilePath** (). That means that multiple imports of the same file on disk using different relative paths will load the file only once.

        **Note:** If an exception is thrown during the loading of the module, the return value will be the exception (typically an `Error` object; see **QJSValue::isError** ()).

        **void QJSEngine::throwError(const QString & message )**

        Throws a run-time error (exception) with the given **message**.

        This method is the C++ counterpart of a `throw()` expression in JavaScript. It enables C++ code to report run-time errors to **QJSEngine** . Therefore it should only be called from C++ code that was invoked by a JavaScript function through **QJSEngine** .

        When returning from C++, the engine will interrupt the normal flow of execution and call the the next pre-registered exception handler with an error object that contains the given **message**. The error object will point to the location of the top-most context on the JavaScript caller stack; specifically, it will have properties `lineNumber`, `fileName` and `stack`. These properties are described in **Script Exceptions** .

        In the following example a C++ method in **FileAccess.cpp** throws an error in **qmlFile.qml** at the position where `readFileAsText()` is called:

        // qmlFile.qml
            function someFunction() {
              ...
              var text = FileAccess.readFileAsText("/path/to/file.txt");
            }

        // FileAccess.cpp
            // Assuming that FileAccess is a QObject-derived class that has been
            // registered as a singleton type and provides an invokable method
            // readFileAsText()

            **QJSValue**  FileAccess::readFileAsText(const **QString**  & filePath) {
              **QFile**  file(filePath);

              if (!file.open(**QIODevice** ::ReadOnly)) {
                jsEngine->throwError(file.errorString());
                return **QString** ();
              }

              ...
              return content;
            }

        It is also possible to catch the thrown error in JavaScript:

        // qmlFile.qml
            function someFunction() {
              ...
              var text;
              try {
                text = FileAccess.readFileAsText("/path/to/file.txt");
              } catch (error) {
                console.warn("In " + error.fileName + ":" + "error.lineNumber" +
                             ": " + error.message);
              }
            }

        If you need a more specific run-time error to describe an exception, you can use the **throwError(QJSValue::ErrorType errorType, const QString &message)**  overload.

        **void QJSEngine::throwError(const QString & message )**

        Throws a run-time error (exception) with the given **message**.

        This method is the C++ counterpart of a `throw()` expression in JavaScript. It enables C++ code to report run-time errors to **QJSEngine** . Therefore it should only be called from C++ code that was invoked by a JavaScript function through **QJSEngine** .

        When returning from C++, the engine will interrupt the normal flow of execution and call the the next pre-registered exception handler with an error object that contains the given **message**. The error object will point to the location of the top-most context on the JavaScript caller stack; specifically, it will have properties `lineNumber`, `fileName` and `stack`. These properties are described in **Script Exceptions** .

        In the following example a C++ method in **FileAccess.cpp** throws an error in **qmlFile.qml** at the position where `readFileAsText()` is called:

        // qmlFile.qml
            function someFunction() {
              ...
              var text = FileAccess.readFileAsText("/path/to/file.txt");
            }

        // FileAccess.cpp
            // Assuming that FileAccess is a QObject-derived class that has been
            // registered as a singleton type and provides an invokable method
            // readFileAsText()

            **QJSValue**  FileAccess::readFileAsText(const **QString**  & filePath) {
              **QFile**  file(filePath);

              if (!file.open(**QIODevice** ::ReadOnly)) {
                jsEngine->throwError(file.errorString());
                return **QString** ();
              }

              ...
              return content;
            }

        It is also possible to catch the thrown error in JavaScript:

        // qmlFile.qml
            function someFunction() {
              ...
              var text;
              try {
                text = FileAccess.readFileAsText("/path/to/file.txt");
              } catch (error) {
                console.warn("In " + error.fileName + ":" + "error.lineNumber" +
                             ": " + error.message);
              }
            }

        If you need a more specific run-time error to describe an exception, you can use the **throwError(QJSValue::ErrorType errorType, const QString &message)**  overload.

        This function was introduced in Qt 5.12.

        This property holds the language to be used for translating user interface strings

        This property holds the name of the language to be used for user interface string translations. It is exposed for reading and writing as `Qt.uiLanguage` when the **QJSEngine::TranslationExtension**  is installed on the engine. It is always exposed in instances of **QQmlEngine** .

        You can set the value freely and use it in bindings. It is recommended to set it after installing translators in your application. By convention, an empty string means no translation from the language used in the source code is intended to occur.

        This property was introduced in Qt 5.15.

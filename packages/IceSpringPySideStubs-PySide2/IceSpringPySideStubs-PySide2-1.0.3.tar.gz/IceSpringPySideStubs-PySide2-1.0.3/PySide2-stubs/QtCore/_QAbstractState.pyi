    **Detailed Description**

    The QAbstractState class is the abstract base class of states that are part of a **QStateMachine** . It defines the interface that all state objects have in common. QAbstractState is part of **The State Machine Framework** .

    The **entered** () signal is emitted when the state has been entered. The **exited** () signal is emitted when the state has been exited.

    The **parentState** () function returns the state's parent state. The **machine** () function returns the state machine that the state is part of.

    **Subclassing**

    The **onEntry** () function is called when the state is entered; reimplement this function to perform custom processing when the state is entered.

    The **onExit** () function is called when the state is exited; reimplement this function to perform custom processing when the state is exited.

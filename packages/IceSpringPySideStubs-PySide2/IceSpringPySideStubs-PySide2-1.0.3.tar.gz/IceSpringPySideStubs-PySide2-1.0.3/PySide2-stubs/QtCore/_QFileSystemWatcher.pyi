    **Detailed Description**

    QFileSystemWatcher monitors the file system for changes to files and directories by watching a list of specified paths.

    Call **addPath** () to watch a particular file or directory. Multiple paths can be added using the **addPaths** () function. Existing paths can be removed by using the **removePath** () and **removePaths** () functions.

    QFileSystemWatcher examines each path added to it. Files that have been added to the QFileSystemWatcher can be accessed using the **files** () function, and directories using the **directories** () function.

    The **fileChanged** () signal is emitted when a file has been modified, renamed or removed from disk. Similarly, the **directoryChanged** () signal is emitted when a directory or its contents is modified or removed. Note that QFileSystemWatcher stops monitoring files once they have been renamed or removed from disk, and directories once they have been removed from disk.

    * **Notes** :
        * On systems running a Linux kernel without inotify support, file systems that contain watched paths cannot be unmounted.
        * The act of monitoring files and directories for modifications consumes system resources. This implies there is a limit to the number of files and directories your process can monitor simultaneously. On all BSD variants, for example, an open file descriptor is required for each monitored file. Some system limits the number of open file descriptors to 256 by default. This means that **addPath** () and **addPaths** () will fail if your process tries to add more than 256 files or directories to the file system monitor. Also note that your process may have other file descriptors open in addition to the ones for files being monitored, and these other open descriptors also count in the total. macOS uses a different backend and does not suffer from this issue.

        **bool QFileSystemWatcher::addPath(const QString & path )**

        Adds **path** to the file system watcher if **path** exists. The path is not added if it does not exist, or if it is already being monitored by the file system watcher.

        If **path** specifies a directory, the **directoryChanged** () signal will be emitted when **path** is modified or removed from disk; otherwise the **fileChanged** () signal is emitted when **path** is modified, renamed or removed.

        If the watch was successful, true is returned.

        Reasons for a watch failure are generally system-dependent, but may include the resource not existing, access failures, or the total watch count limit, if the platform has one.

        **Note:** There may be a system dependent limit to the number of files and directories that can be monitored simultaneously. If this limit is been reached, **path** will not be monitored, and false is returned.

        Adds each path in **paths** to the file system watcher. Paths are not added if they not exist, or if they are already being monitored by the file system watcher.

        If a path specifies a directory, the **directoryChanged** () signal will be emitted when the path is modified or removed from disk; otherwise the **fileChanged** () signal is emitted when the path is modified, renamed, or removed.

        The return value is a list of paths that could not be watched.

        **[signal] void QFileSystemWatcher::directoryChanged(const QString & path )**

        This signal is emitted when the directory at a specified **path** is modified (e.g., when a file is added or deleted) or removed from disk. Note that if there are several changes during a short period of time, some of the changes might not emit this signal. However, the last change in the sequence of changes will always generate this signal.

        This signal is emitted when the file at the specified **path** is modified, renamed or removed from disk.

        **Note:** As a safety measure, many applications save an open file by writing a new file and then deleting the old one. In your slot function, you can check `watcher.files().contains(path)`. If it returns `false`, check whether the file still exists and then call `addPath()` to continue watching it.

        **[static] QString QStandardPaths::findExecutable(const QString & executableName , const QStringList & paths = QStringList())**

        Finds the executable named **executableName** in the specified **paths** , or the system paths if paths is empty.

        On most operating systems the system path is determined by the `PATH` environment variable. The directories where to search for the executable can be set in the paths argument. To search in both your own paths and the system paths, call findExecutable twice, once with paths set and once with paths empty. Symlinks are not resolved in order to preserve behavior for the case of executables whose behavior depends on the name they are invoked with .

        **Note:** On Windows, the usual executable extensions (from the PATHEXT environment variable) are automatically appended. For example, the findExecutable("foo") call finds `foo.exe` or `foo.bat` if present.

        Returns the absolute file path to the executable, or an empty string if not found.

        Finds a file or directory called **fileName** in the standard locations for **type**.

        The **options** flag lets you specify whether to look for files or directories. By default, this flag is set to `LocateFile`.

        The **options** flag lets you specify whether to look for files or directories. By default, this flag is set to `LocateFile`.

        **[static] void QStandardPaths::setTestModeEnabled(bool testMode )**

        If **testMode** is `true`, this enables a special "test mode" in **QStandardPaths** , which changes writable locations to point to test directories. This prevents auto tests from reading or writing to the current user\'s configuration.

        It affects the locations into which test programs might write files: `GenericDataLocation`, `DataLocation`, `ConfigLocation`, `GenericConfigLocation`, `AppConfigLocation`, `GenericCacheLocation`, and `CacheLocation`. Other locations are not affected.

        On Unix, `XDG_DATA_HOME` is set to `~/.qttest/share`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set to `~/.qttest/config`, and `XDG_CACHE_HOME` is set to `~/.qttest/cache`.

        On macOS, data goes to `~/.qttest/Application Support`, cache goes to `~/.qttest/Cache`, and config goes to `~/.qttest/Preferences`.

        On Windows, everything goes to a "qttest" directory under `%APPDATA%`.

        The list of directories is sorted from high to low priority, starting with **writableLocation** () if it can be determined. This list is empty if no locations for type are defined.

        **Note:** The storage location returned may not exist; that is, it may need to be created by the system or the user.

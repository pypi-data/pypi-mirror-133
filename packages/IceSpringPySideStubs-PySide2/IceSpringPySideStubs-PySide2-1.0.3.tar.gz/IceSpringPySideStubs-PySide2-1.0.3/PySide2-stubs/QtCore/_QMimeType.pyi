    **Detailed Description**

    For instance a file named "readme.txt" has the MIME type "text/plain". The MIME type can be determined from the file name, or from the file contents, or from both. MIME type determination can also be done on buffers of data not coming from files.

    Determining the MIME type of a file can be useful to make sure your application supports it. It is also useful in file-manager-like applications or widgets, in order to display an appropriate **icon**  for the file, or even the descriptive **comment**  in detailed views.

    To check if a file has the expected MIME type, you should use **inherits** () rather than a simple string comparison based on the **name** (). This is because MIME types can inherit from each other: for instance a C source file is a specific type of plain text file, so text/x-csrc inherits text/plain.

        For instance, for image/svg+xml the list would be: application/xml, text/plain, application/octet-stream.

        This should be used if the icon returned by **iconName** () cannot be found on the system. It is used for categories of similar types (like spreadsheets or archives) that can use a common icon. The freedesktop.org Icon Naming Specification lists a set of such icon names.

        **parentMimeTypes : const QStringList**

        This property holds the names of parent MIME types

        A type is a subclass of another type if any instance of the first type is also an instance of the second. For example, all image/svg+xml files are also text/xml, text/plain and application/octet-stream files. Subclassing is about the format, rather than the category of the data (for example, there is no 'generic spreadsheet' class that all spreadsheets inherit from). Conversely, the parent mimetype of image/svg+xml is text/xml.

        A mimetype can have multiple parents. For instance application/x-perl has two parents: application/x-executable and text/plain. This makes it possible to both execute perl scripts, and to open them in text editors.

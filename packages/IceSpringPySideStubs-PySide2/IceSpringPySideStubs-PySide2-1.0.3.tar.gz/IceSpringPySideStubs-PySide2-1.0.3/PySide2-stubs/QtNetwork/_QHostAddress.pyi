    **Detailed Description**

    This class holds an IPv4 or IPv6 address in a platform- and protocol-independent manner.

    QHostAddress is normally used with the **QTcpSocket** , **QTcpServer** , and **QUdpSocket**  to connect to a host or to set up a server.

    A host address is set with **setAddress** (), and retrieved with **toIPv4Address** (), **toIPv6Address** (), or **toString** (). You can check the type with **protocol** ().

    **Note:** Please note that QHostAddress does not do DNS lookups. **QHostInfo**  is needed for that.

    The class also supports common predefined addresses: **Null** , **LocalHost** , **LocalHostIPv6** , **Broadcast** , and **Any** .

    **See also** **QHostInfo** , **QTcpSocket** , **QTcpServer** , and **QUdpSocket** .

        Parses the IP and subnet information contained in **subnet** and returns the network prefix for that network and its prefix length.

        The IP address and the netmask must be separated by a slash (/).

        This function supports arguments in the form:

If the netmask is also missing in that case, it is set to the number of octets actually passed (in the example above, it would be 24, for 3 octets).

        Returns the scope ID of an IPv6 address. For IPv4 addresses, or if the address does not contain a scope ID, an empty **QString**  is returned.

        The IPv6 scope ID specifies the scope of **reachability** for non-global IPv6 addresses, limiting the area in which the address can be used. All IPv6 addresses are associated with such a reachability scope. The scope ID is used to disambiguate addresses that are not guaranteed to be globally unique.

        IPv6 specifies the following four levels of reachability:

        * Node-local: Addresses that are only used for communicating with services on the same interface (e.g., the loopback interface "::1").
          * Link-local: Addresses that are local to the network interface ( **link** ). There is always one link-local address for each IPv6 interface on your host. Link-local addresses ("fe80...") are generated from the MAC address of the local network adaptor, and are not guaranteed to be unique.
          * Global: For globally routable addresses, such as public servers on the Internet.

        When using a link-local or site-local address for IPv6 connections, you must specify the scope ID. The scope ID for a link-local address is usually the same as the interface name (e.g., "eth0", "en1") or number (e.g., "1", "2").

        Returns the IPv6 address as a Q_IPV6ADDR structure. The structure consists of 16 unsigned characters.

        Q_IPV6ADDR addr = hostAddr.toIPv6Address();
            // addr contains 16 unsigned characters

            for (int i = 0; i < 16; ++i) {
                // process addr[i]
            }

        This value is valid if the **protocol** () is **IPv6Protocol** . If the protocol is **IPv4Protocol** , then the address is returned an an IPv4 mapped IPv6 address. (RFC4291)

        Returns the address as a string.

        For example, if the address is the IPv4 address 127.0.0.1, the returned string is "127.0.0.1". For IPv6 the string format will follow the RFC5952 recommendation. For **QHostAddress::Any** , its IPv4 address will be returned ("0.0.0.0")

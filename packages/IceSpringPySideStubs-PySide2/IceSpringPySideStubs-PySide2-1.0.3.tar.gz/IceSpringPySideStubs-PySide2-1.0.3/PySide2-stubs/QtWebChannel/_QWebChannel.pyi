    **Detailed Description**

    The QWebChannel fills the gap between C++ applications and HTML/JavaScript applications. By publishing a **QObject**  derived object to a QWebChannel and using the **qwebchannel.js**  on the HTML side, one can transparently access properties and public slots and methods of the **QObject** . No manual message passing and serialization of data is required, property updates and signal emission on the C++ side get automatically transmitted to the potentially remotely running HTML clients. On the client side, a JavaScript object will be created for any published C++ **QObject** . It mirrors the C++ object's API and thus is intuitively useable.

    The C++ QWebChannel API makes it possible to talk to any HTML client, which could run on a local or even remote machine. The only limitation is that the HTML client supports the JavaScript features used by `qwebchannel.js`. As such, one can interact with basically any modern HTML browser or standalone JavaScript runtime, such as node.js.

    There also exists a declarative **WebChannel API** .

    **See also** **Qt WebChannel Standalone Example**  and **JavaScript API** .

        **QWebChannel::QWebChannel(QObject * parent = Q_NULLPTR)**

        Constructs the QWebChannel object with the given **parent**.

        Note that a QWebChannel is only fully operational once you connect it to a **QWebChannelAbstractTransport** . The HTML clients also need to be setup appropriately using [`qwebchannel.js`** .

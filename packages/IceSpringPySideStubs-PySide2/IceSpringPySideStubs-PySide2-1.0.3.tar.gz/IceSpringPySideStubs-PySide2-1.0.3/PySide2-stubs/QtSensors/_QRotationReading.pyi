    **Detailed Description**

    **QRotationReading Units**

    The rotation reading contains 3 angles, measured in degrees that define the orientation of the device in three-dimensional space. These angles are similar to yaw, pitch and roll but are defined using only right hand rotation with axes as defined by the right hand cartesian coordinate system.

    ![](images/sensors-rotation.jpg)

    The three angles are applied to the device in the following order.

    * Right-handed rotation z (-180, 180]. Starting from the y-axis and incrementing in the counter-clockwise direction.
      * Right-handed rotation x [-90, 90]. Starting from the new (once-rotated) y-axis and incrementing towards the z-axis.
      * Right-handed rotation y (-180, 180]. Starting from the new (twice-rotated) z-axis and incrementing towards the x-axis.

    Here is a visualization showing the order in which angles are applied.

    ![](images/sensors-rotation-anim.gif)

    The 0 point for the z angle is defined as a fixed, external entity and is device-specific. While magnetic North is typically used as this reference point it may not be. Do not attempt to compare values for the z angle between devices or even on the same device if it has moved a significant distance.

    If the device cannot detect a fixed, external entity the z angle will always be 0 and the **QRotationSensor::hasZ**  property will be set to false.

    The 0 point for the x and y angles are defined as when the x and y axes of the device are oriented towards the horizon. Here is an example of how the x value will change with device movement.

    Here is an example of how the y value will change with device movement.

    Note that when x is 90 or -90, values for z and y achieve rotation around the same axis (due to the order of operations). In this case the y rotation will be 0.

        **void QRotationReading::setFromEuler(qreal x , qreal y , qreal z )**

        Sets the rotation from three euler angles.

        This is to be called from the backend.

        The angles are measured in degrees. The order of the rotations matters, as first the **z** rotation is applied, then the **x** rotation and finally the **y** rotation.

        This function was introduced in Qt 5.0.

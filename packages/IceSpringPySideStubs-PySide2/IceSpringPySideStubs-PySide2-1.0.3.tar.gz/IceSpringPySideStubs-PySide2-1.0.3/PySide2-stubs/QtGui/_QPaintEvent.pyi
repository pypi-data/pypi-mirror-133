    **Detailed Description**

    Paint events are sent to widgets that need to update themselves, for instance when part of a widget is exposed because a covering widget was moved.

    The event contains a **region** () that needs to be updated, and a **rect** () that is the bounding rectangle of that region. Both are provided because many widgets cannot make much use of **region** (), and **rect** () can be much faster than **region** ().boundingRect().

    **Automatic Clipping**

    Painting is clipped to **region** () during the processing of a paint event. This clipping is performed by Qt's paint system and is independent of any clipping that may be applied to a **QPainter**  used to draw on the paint device.

    As a result, the value returned by **QPainter::clipRegion** () on a newly-constructed **QPainter**  will not reflect the clip region that is used by the paint system.

    **See also** **QPainter** , **QWidget::update** (), **QWidget::repaint** (), and **QWidget::paintEvent** ().

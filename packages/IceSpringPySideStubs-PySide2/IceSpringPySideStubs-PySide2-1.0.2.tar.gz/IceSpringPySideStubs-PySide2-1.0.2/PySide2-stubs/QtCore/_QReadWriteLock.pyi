    **Detailed Description**

    A read-write lock is a synchronization tool for protecting resources that can be accessed for reading and writing. This type of lock is useful if you want to allow multiple threads to have simultaneous read-only access, but as soon as one thread wants to write to the resource, all other threads must be blocked until the writing is complete.

    In many cases, QReadWriteLock is a direct competitor to **QMutex** . QReadWriteLock is a good choice if there are many concurrent reads and writing occurs infrequently.

    Example:

    **QReadWriteLock**  lock;

        void ReaderThread::run()
        {
            ...
            lock.lockForRead();
            read_file();
            lock.unlock();
            ...
        }

        void WriterThread::run()
        {
            ...
            lock.lockForWrite();
            write_file();
            lock.unlock();
            ...
        }

    To ensure that writers aren't blocked forever by readers, readers attempting to obtain a lock will not succeed if there is a blocked writer waiting for access, even if the lock is currently only accessed by other readers. Also, if the lock is accessed by a writer and another writer comes in, that writer will have priority over any readers that might also be waiting.

    Like **QMutex** , a QReadWriteLock can be recursively locked by the same thread when constructed with **QReadWriteLock::Recursive**  as **QReadWriteLock::RecursionMode** . In such cases, **unlock** () must be called the same number of times **lockForWrite** () or **lockForRead** () was called. Note that the lock type cannot be changed when trying to lock recursively, i.e. it is not possible to lock for reading in a thread that already has locked for writing (and vice versa).

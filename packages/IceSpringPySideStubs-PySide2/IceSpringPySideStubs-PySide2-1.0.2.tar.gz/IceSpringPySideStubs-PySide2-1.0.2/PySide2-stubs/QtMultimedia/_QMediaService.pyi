    **Detailed Description**

    Media services provide implementations of the functionality promised by media objects, and allow multiple providers to implement a **QMediaObject** .

    To provide the functionality of a **QMediaObject**  media services implement **QMediaControl**  interfaces. Services typically implement one core media control which provides the core feature of a media object, and some number of additional controls which provide either optional features of the media object, or features of a secondary media object or peripheral object.

    A pointer to media service\'s **QMediaControl**  implementation can be obtained by passing the control\'s interface name to the **requestControl** () function.

    **QMediaPlayerControl**  *control = qobject_cast<**QMediaPlayerControl**  *>(
                mediaService->requestControl("org.qt-project.qt.mediaplayercontrol/5.0"));

    Media objects can use services loaded dynamically from plug-ins or implemented statically within an applications. Plug-in based services should also implement the **QMediaServiceProviderPlugin**  interface. Static services should implement the QMediaServiceProvider interface. In general, implementing a QMediaService is outside of the scope of this documentation and support on the relevant mailing lists or IRC channels should be sought.

    **See also** **QMediaObject**  and **QMediaControl** .

        Controls must be returned to the service when no longer needed using the **releaseControl** () function.

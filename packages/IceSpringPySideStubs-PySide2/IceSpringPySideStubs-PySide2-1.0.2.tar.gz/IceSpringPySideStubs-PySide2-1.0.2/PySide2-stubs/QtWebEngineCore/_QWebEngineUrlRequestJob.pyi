    **Detailed Description**

    A QWebEngineUrlRequestJob is given to **QWebEngineUrlSchemeHandler::requestStarted** () and must be handled by the derived implementations of the class. The job can be handled by calling either **reply** (), **redirect** (), or **fail** ().

    The class is owned by the web engine and does not need to be deleted. However, the web engine may delete the job when it is no longer needed, and therefore the signal **QObject::destroyed** () must be monitored if a pointer to the object is stored.

        **void QWebEngineUrlRequestJob::fail(QWebEngineUrlRequestJob::Error r )**

        Fails the request with the error **r**.

        **QUrl QWebEngineUrlRequestJob::initiator() const**

        Returns the serialized origin of the content that initiated the request.

        Generally, the origin consists of a scheme, hostname, and port. For example, `"http://localhost:8080"` would be a valid origin. The port is omitted if it is the scheme\'s default port (80 for `http`, 443 for `https`). The hostname is omitted for non-network schemes such as `file` and `qrc`.

        However, there is also the special value `"null"` representing a unique origin. It is, for example, the origin of a sandboxed iframe. The purpose of this special origin is to be always different from all other origins in the same-origin check. In other words, content with a unique origin should never have privileged access to any other content.

        Finally, if the request was not initiated by web content, the function will return an empty **QUrl** . This happens, for example, when you call **QWebEnginePage::setUrl** ().

        This value can be used for implementing secure cross-origin checks.

        This function was introduced in Qt 5.11.

        https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwebengineurlrequestjob.html#redirect

        Redirects the request to **url**.

        **void QWebEngineUrlRequestJob::reply(const QByteArray & contentType , QIODevice * device )**

        Replies to the request with **device** and the MIME type **contentType**.

        The user has to be aware that **device** will be used on another thread until the job is deleted. In case simultaneous access from the main thread is desired, the user is reponsible for making access to **device** thread-safe for example by using **QMutex** . Note that the **device** object is not owned by the web engine. Therefore, the signal **QObject::destroyed** () of **QWebEngineUrlRequestJob**  must be monitored.

        The device should remain available at least as long as the job exists. When calling this method with a newly constructed device, one solution is to make the device as a child of the job or delete itself when job is deleted, like this:

        connect(job, &**QObject** ::destroyed, device, &**QObject** ::deleteLater);

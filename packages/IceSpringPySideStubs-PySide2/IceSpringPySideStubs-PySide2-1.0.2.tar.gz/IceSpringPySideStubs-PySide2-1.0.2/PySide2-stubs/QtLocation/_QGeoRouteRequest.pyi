    **Detailed Description**

    The default state of a QGeoRouteRequest instance will result in a request for basic route segment and navigation maneuvers describing the fastest route by car which covers the given waypoints.

    There may be significant variation in the features supported by different providers of routing information, or even in the features supported by the same provider if different levels of authorization are used.

    There are several functions in **QGeoRoutingManager**  which can be used to check which features are supported with the current provider and authorization level.

    **See also** **QGeoRoutingManager** .

    **Detailed Description**

    The **geocode** () and **reverseGeocode** () functions return **QGeoCodeReply**  objects, which manage these operations and report on the result of the operations and any errors which may have occurred.

    The **geocode** () and **reverseGeocode** () functions can be used to convert **QGeoAddress**  instances to **QGeoCoordinate**  instances and vice-versa.

    The **geocode** () function is also overloaded to allow a user to perform a free text geocoding operation, if the string provided can be interpreted as an address it can be geocoded to coordinate information.

    Instances of QGeoCodingManager can be accessed with **QGeoServiceProvider::geocodingManager** ().

        **QGeoCodeReply *QGeoCodingManager::geocode(const QGeoAddress & address , const QGeoShape & bounds = QGeoShape())**

        Begins the geocoding of **address**. Geocoding is the process of finding a coordinate that corresponds to a given address.

        A **QGeoCodeReply**  object will be returned, which can be used to manage the geocoding operation and to return the results of the operation.

        This manager and the returned **QGeoCodeReply**  object will emit signals indicating if the operation completes or if errors occur.

        If supportsGeocoding() returns false an **QGeoCodeReply::UnsupportedOptionError**  will occur.

        Once the operation has completed, **QGeoCodeReply::locations** () can be used to retrieve the results, which will consist of a list of **QGeoLocation**  objects. These objects represent a combination of coordinate and address data.

        The address data returned in the results may be different from **address**. This will usually occur if the geocoding service backend uses a different canonical form of addresses or if **address** was only partially filled out.

        If **bounds** is non-null and is a valid **QGeoShape**  it will be used to limit the results to those that are contained within **bounds**. This is particularly useful if **address** is only partially filled out, as the service will attempt to geocode all matches for the specified data.

        The user is responsible for deleting the returned reply object, although this can be done in the slot connected to **QGeoCodingManager::finished** (), **QGeoCodingManager::error** (), **QGeoCodeReply::finished** () or **QGeoCodeReply::error** () with **deleteLater** ().

        Begins the reverse geocoding of **coordinate**. Reverse geocoding is the process of finding an address that corresponds to a given coordinate.

        A **QGeoCodeReply**  object will be returned, which can be used to manage the reverse geocoding operation and to return the results of the operation.

        At that point **QGeoCodeReply::locations** () can be used to retrieve the results, which will consist of a list of **QGeoLocation**  objects. These objects represent a combination of coordinate and address data.

        The coordinate data returned in the results may be different from **coordinate**. This will usually occur if the reverse geocoding service backend shifts the coordinates to be closer to the matching addresses, or if the backend returns results at multiple levels of detail.

        If multiple results are returned by the reverse geocoding service backend they will be provided in order of specificity. This normally occurs if the backend is configured to reverse geocode across multiple levels of detail. As an example, some services will return address and coordinate pairs for the street address, the city, the state and the country.

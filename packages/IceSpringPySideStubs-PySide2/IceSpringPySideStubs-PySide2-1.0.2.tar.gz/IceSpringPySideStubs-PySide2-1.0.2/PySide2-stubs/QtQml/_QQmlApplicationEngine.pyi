    **Detailed Description**

    This class combines a **QQmlEngine**  and **QQmlComponent**  to provide a convenient way to load a single QML file. It also exposes some central application functionality to QML, which a C++/QML hybrid application would normally control from C++.

    It can be used like so:

    #include <QGuiApplication>
        #include <QQmlApplicationEngine>

        int main(int argc, char *argv[])
        {
            **QGuiApplication**  app(argc, argv);
            **QQmlApplicationEngine**  engine("main.qml");
            return app.exec();
        }

    Unlike **QQuickView** , QQmlApplicationEngine does not automatically create a root window. If you are using visual items from Qt Quick, you will need to place them inside of a **Window** .

    You can also use **QCoreApplication**  with QQmlApplicationEngine, if you are not using any QML modules which require a **QGuiApplication**  (such as `QtQuick`).

    List of configuration changes from a default **QQmlEngine** :

    * Connecting Qt.**quit** () to **QCoreApplication::quit** ()
      * Automatically loads translation files from an i18n directory adjacent to the main QML file.
        * Translation files must have "**qml_** " prefix e.g. qml_ja_JP.qm.
      * Translations are reloaded when the `QJSEngine::uiLanguage` / `Qt.uiLanguage` property is changed.
      * Automatically sets an incubation controller if the scene contains a **QQuickWindow** .
      * Automatically sets a `QQmlFileSelector` as the url interceptor, applying file selectors to all QML files and assets.

    The engine behavior can be further tweaked by using the inherited methods from **QQmlEngine** .

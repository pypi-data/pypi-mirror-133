    **Detailed Description**

    Wheel events are sent to the widget under the mouse cursor, but if that widget does not handle the event they are sent to the focus widget. Wheel events are generated for both mouse wheels and trackpad scroll gestures. There are two ways to read the wheel event delta: **angleDelta** () returns the deltas in wheel degrees. These values are always provided. **pixelDelta** () returns the deltas in screen pixels, and is available on platforms that have high-resolution trackpads, such as macOS. If that is the case, **source** () will return **Qt::MouseEventSynthesizedBySystem** .

    The functions pos() and globalPos() return the mouse cursor's location at the time of the event.

    A wheel event contains a special accept flag that indicates whether the receiver wants the event. You should call **ignore** () if you do not handle the wheel event; this ensures that it will be sent to the parent widget.

    The **QWidget::setEnabled** () function can be used to enable or disable mouse and keyboard events for a widget.

    The event handler **QWidget::wheelEvent** () receives wheel events.

    **See also** **QMouseEvent**  and **QWidget::grabMouse** ().

    def angleDelta(self) -> PySide2.QtCore.QPoint:
        """
        https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwheelevent.html#angleDelta

        **QPoint QWheelEvent::angleDelta() const**

        Returns the relative amount that the wheel was rotated, in eighths of a degree. A positive value indicates that the wheel was rotated forwards away from the user; a negative value indicates that the wheel was rotated backwards toward the user. `angleDelta().y()` provides the angle through which the common vertical mouse wheel was rotated since the previous event. `angleDelta().x()` provides the angle through which the horizontal mouse wheel was rotated, if the mouse has a horizontal wheel; otherwise it stays at zero. Some mice allow the user to tilt the wheel to perform horizontal scrolling, and some touchpads support a horizontal scrolling gesture; that will also appear in `angleDelta().x()`.

        Most mouse types work in steps of 15 degrees, in which case the delta value is a multiple of 120; i.e., 120 units * 1/8 = 15 degrees.

        However, some mice have finer-resolution wheels and send delta values that are less than 120 units (less than 15 degrees). To support this possibility, you can either cumulatively add the delta values from events until the value of 120 is reached, then scroll the widget, or you can partially scroll the widget in response to each wheel event. But to provide a more native feel, you should prefer **pixelDelta** () on platforms where it's available.

        Example:

        void MyWidget::wheelEvent(**QWheelEvent**  *event)
            {
                **QPoint**  numPixels = event->pixelDelta();
                **QPoint**  numDegrees = event->angleDelta() / 8;

                if (!numPixels.isNull()) {
                    scrollWithPixels(numPixels);
                } else if (!numDegrees.isNull()) {
                    **QPoint**  numSteps = numDegrees / 15;
                    scrollWithDegrees(numSteps);
                }

                event->accept();
            }

        **Note:** On platforms that support scrolling **phases** , the delta may be null when:

        * scrolling is about to begin, but the distance did not yet change (**Qt::ScrollBegin** ),
          * or scrolling has ended and the distance did not change anymore (**Qt::ScrollEnd** ).

        **QPointF QWheelEvent::globalPosition() const**

        Returns the global position of the mouse pointer **at the time of the event**. This is important on asynchronous window systems such as X11; whenever you move your widgets around in response to mouse events, globalPosition() can differ a lot from the current cursor position returned by **QCursor::pos** ().

        **bool QWheelEvent::inverted() const**

        Returns whether the delta values delivered with the event are inverted.

        Normally, a vertical wheel will produce a **QWheelEvent**  with positive delta values if the top of the wheel is rotating away from the hand operating it. Similarly, a horizontal wheel movement will produce a **QWheelEvent**  with positive delta values if the top of the wheel is moved to the left.

        However, on some platforms this is configurable, so that the same operations described above will produce negative delta values (but with the same magnitude). With the inverted property a wheel event consumer can choose to always follow the direction of the wheel, regardless of the system settings, but only for specific widgets. (One such use case could be that the user is rotating the wheel in the same direction as a visual Tumbler rotates. Another usecase is to make a slider handle follow the direction of movement of fingers on a touchpad regardless of system configuration.)

        **Note:** Many platforms provide no such information. On such platforms inverted always returns false.

        This function was introduced in Qt 5.7.

        **QPoint QWheelEvent::pixelDelta() const**

        Returns the scrolling distance in pixels on screen. This value is provided on platforms that support high-resolution pixel-based delta values, such as macOS. The value should be used directly to scroll content on screen.

        Example:

        void MyWidget::wheelEvent(**QWheelEvent**  *event)
            {
                **QPoint**  numPixels = event->pixelDelta();

                    **QPoint**  numSteps = numDegrees / 15;

        * scrolling is about to begin, but the distance did not yet change (**Qt::ScrollBegin** ),
          * or scrolling has ended and the distance did not change anymore (**Qt::ScrollEnd** ).

        **Note:** On X11 this value is driver specific and unreliable, use **angleDelta** () instead

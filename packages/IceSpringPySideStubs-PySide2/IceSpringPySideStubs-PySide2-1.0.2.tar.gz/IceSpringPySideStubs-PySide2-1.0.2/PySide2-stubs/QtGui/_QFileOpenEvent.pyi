    **Detailed Description**

    File open events will be sent to the **QApplication::instance** () when the operating system requests that a file or URL should be opened. This is a high-level event that can be caused by different user actions depending on the user\'s desktop environment; for example, double clicking on an file icon in the Finder on macOS.

    This event is only used to notify the application of a request. It may be safely ignored.

    **Note:** This class is currently supported for macOS only.

    **macOS Example**

    In order to trigger the event on macOS, the application must be configured to let the OS know what kind of file(s) it should react on.

    For example, the following `Info.plist` file declares that the application can act as a viewer for files with a PNG extension:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
        <plist version="1.0">
        <dict>
            <key>CFBundleDocumentTypes</key>
            <array>
                <dict>
                    <key>CFBundleTypeExtensions</key>
                    <array>
                        <string>png</string>
                    </array>
                    <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
                    <string>Viewer</string>
                </dict>
            </array>
        </dict>
        </plist>

    The following implementation of a **QApplication**  subclass prints the path to the file that was, for example, dropped on the Dock icon of the application.

    #include <QApplication>
        #include <QFileOpenEvent>
        #include <QtDebug>

        class MyApplication : public **QApplication**
        {
        public:
            MyApplication(int &argc, char **argv)
                : **QApplication** (argc, argv)
            {
            }

            bool event(**QEvent**  *event) override
            {
                if (event->type() == **QEvent** ::FileOpen) {
                    QFileOpenEvent *openEvent = static_cast<QFileOpenEvent *>(event);
                    **qDebug** () << "Open file" << openEvent->file();
                }

                return **QApplication** ::event(event);
            }
        };

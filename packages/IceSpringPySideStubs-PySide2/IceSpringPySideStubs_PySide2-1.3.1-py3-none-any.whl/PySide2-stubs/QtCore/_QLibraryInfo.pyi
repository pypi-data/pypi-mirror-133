    **Detailed Description**

    Many pieces of information are established when Qt is configured and built.
    This class provides an abstraction for accessing that information. By using
    the static functions of this class, an application can obtain information
    about the instance of the Qt library which the application is using at run-
    time.

    You can also use a `qt.conf` file to override the hard-coded paths that are
    compiled into the Qt library. For more information, see the **Using
    qt.conf**  documentation.

    **See also** **QSysInfo**  and **Using qt.conf** .

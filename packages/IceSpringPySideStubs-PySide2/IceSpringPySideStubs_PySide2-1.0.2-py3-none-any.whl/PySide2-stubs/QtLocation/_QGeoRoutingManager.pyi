    """
    https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qgeoroutingmanager.html

    **Detailed Description**

    The **calculateRoute** () and **updateRoute** () methods function **QGeoRouteReply**  objects, which manage these operations and report on the result of the operations and any errors which may have occurred.

    The **calculateRoute** () function is used to find a route (or routes) that follows a set of waypoints and matches various other criteria. The **QGeoRouteRequest**  class is used to specify this information.

    If supportsRouteUpdates() returns true then the QGeoRoutingManager supports updating route information based on position updates. This will cause the travel time and distance estimates to be updated, and any QGeoRouteSegments already traversed to be removed from the route.

    The updates can be triggered with the **updateRoute** () function, which makes use of the **QGeoPositionInfo**  instances emitted as position updates by **QGeoPositionInfoSource** .

    Instances of QGeoRoutingManager can be accessed with **QGeoServiceProvider::routingManager** ().

    A small example of the usage of QGeoRoutingManager and QGeoRouteRequests follows:

    class MyRouteHandler : public **QObject**
        {
            Q_OBJECT
        public:
            MyRouteHandler(QGeoRoutingManager *routingManager,
                           const **QGeoCoordinate**  &origin,
                           const **QGeoCoordinate**  &destination) {

                **QGeoRouteRequest**  request(origin, destination);

                // The request defaults to the fastest route by car, which is
                // equivalent to:
                // request.setTravelMode(QGeoRouteRequest::CarTravel);
                // request.setRouteOptimization(QGeoRouteRequest::FastestRoute);

                request.setAvoidFeatureTypes(**QGeoRouteRequest** ::AvoidTolls);
                request.setAvoidFeatureTypes(**QGeoRouteRequest** ::AvoidMotorPoolLanes);

                **QGeoRouteRequest** ::AvoidFeaturesTypes avoidableFeatures = routingManager->supportedAvoidFeatureTypes();

                if (!(avoidableFeatures & request.avoidFeatureTypes())) {
                    // ... inform the user that the routing manager does not
                    // provide support for avoiding tolls and/or motor pool lanes ...
                    return;
                }

                if (reply->isFinished()) {
                    if (reply->error() == **QGeoRouteReply** ::NoError) {
                        routeCalculated(reply);
                    } else {
                        routeError(reply, reply->error(), reply->errorString());

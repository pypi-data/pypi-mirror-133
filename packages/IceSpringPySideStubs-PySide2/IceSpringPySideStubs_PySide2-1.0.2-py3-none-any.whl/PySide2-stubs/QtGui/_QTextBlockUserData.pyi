    **Detailed Description**

    QTextBlockUserData provides an abstract interface for container classes that are used to associate application-specific user data with text blocks in a **QTextDocument** .

    Generally, subclasses of this class provide functions to allow data to be stored and retrieved, and instances are attached to blocks of text using **QTextBlock::setUserData** (). This makes it possible to store additional data per text block in a way that can be retrieved safely by the application.

    Each subclass should provide a reimplementation of the destructor to ensure that any private data is automatically cleaned up when user data objects are deleted.

    **See also** **QTextBlock** .

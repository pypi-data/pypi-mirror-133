    **Detailed Description**

    Each **QTouchEvent**  contains a QTouchDevice pointer to allow accessing device-specific properties like type and capabilities. It is the responsibility of the platform or generic plug-ins to register the available touch devices via QWindowSystemInterface before generating any touch events. Applications do not need to instantiate this class, they should just access the global instances pointed to by **QTouchEvent::device** ().

        **Note:** The returned list cannot be used to add new devices. To add a simulated touch screen for an autotest, **QTest::createTouchDevice** () can be used. To add real touch screens to QPA plugins, the private `QWindowSystemInterface::registerTouchDevice()` function can be used.

        This function was introduced in Qt 5.2.

        This string may often be empty. It is however useful for systems that have more than one touch input device because there it can be used to differentiate between the devices (i.e. to tell from which device a **QTouchEvent**  originates from).

    **Detailed Description**

    UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a lightweight, unreliable, datagram-oriented, connectionless protocol. It can be used when reliability isn't important. QUdpSocket is a subclass of **QAbstractSocket**  that allows you to send and receive UDP datagrams.

    The most common way to use this class is to bind to an address and port using **bind** (), then call **writeDatagram** () and **readDatagram** () / **receiveDatagram** () to transfer data. If you want to use the standard **QIODevice**  functions **read** (), **readLine** (), **write** (), etc., you must first connect the socket directly to a peer by calling **connectToHost** ().

    The socket emits the **bytesWritten** () signal every time a datagram is written to the network. If you just want to send datagrams, you don't need to call **bind** ().

    The **readyRead** () signal is emitted whenever datagrams arrive. In that case, **hasPendingDatagrams** () returns `true`. Call **pendingDatagramSize** () to obtain the size of the first pending datagram, and **readDatagram** () or **receiveDatagram** () to read it.

    **Note:** An incoming datagram should be read when you receive the **readyRead** () signal, otherwise this signal will not be emitted for the next datagram.

    Example:

    void Server::initSocket()
        {
            udpSocket = new **QUdpSocket** (this);
            udpSocket->bind(**QHostAddress** ::LocalHost, 7755);

            connect(udpSocket, &**QUdpSocket** ::readyRead,
                    this, &Server::readPendingDatagrams);
        }

        void Server::readPendingDatagrams()
        {
            while (udpSocket->hasPendingDatagrams()) {
                **QNetworkDatagram**  datagram = udpSocket->receiveDatagram();
                processTheDatagram(datagram);
            }
        }

    QUdpSocket also supports UDP multicast. Use **joinMulticastGroup** () and **leaveMulticastGroup** () to control group membership, and **QAbstractSocket::MulticastTtlOption**  and **QAbstractSocket::MulticastLoopbackOption**  to set the TTL and loopback socket options. Use **setMulticastInterface** () to control the outgoing interface for multicast datagrams, and **multicastInterface** () to query it.

    With QUdpSocket, you can also establish a virtual connection to a UDP server using **connectToHost** () and then use **read** () and **write** () to exchange datagrams without specifying the receiver for each datagram.

    The **Broadcast Sender** , **Broadcast Receiver** , **Multicast Sender** , and **Multicast Receiver**  examples illustrate how to use QUdpSocket in applications.

        **bool QUdpSocket::joinMulticastGroup(const QHostAddress & groupAddress )**

        Joins the multicast group specified by **groupAddress** on the default interface chosen by the operating system. The socket must be in **BoundState** , otherwise an error occurs.

        Note that if you are attempting to join an IPv4 group, your socket must not be bound using IPv6 (or in dual mode, using **QHostAddress::Any** ). You must use **QHostAddress::AnyIPv4**  instead.

        This function returns `true` if successful; otherwise it returns `false` and sets the socket error accordingly.

        **Note:** Joining IPv6 multicast groups without an interface selection is not supported in all operating systems. Consider using the overload where the interface is specified.

        This function was introduced in Qt 4.8.

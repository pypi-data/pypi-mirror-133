    **Detailed Description**

    On Windows this is a named pipe and on Unix this is a local domain socket.

    If an error occurs, **error** () returns the type of error, and **errorString** () can be called to get a human readable description of what happened.

    Although QLocalSocket is designed for use with an event loop, it's possible to use it without one. In that case, you must use **waitForConnected** (), **waitForReadyRead** (), **waitForBytesWritten** (), and **waitForDisconnected** () which blocks until the operation is complete or the timeout expires.

    **See also** **QLocalServer** .

        This function writes as much as possible from the internal write buffer to the socket, without blocking. If any data was written, this function returns `true`; otherwise false is returned.

        Call this function if you need **QLocalSocket**  to start sending buffered data immediately. The number of bytes successfully written depends on the operating system. In most cases, you do not need to call this function, because **QLocalSocket**  will start sending data automatically once control goes back to the event loop.

        Equivalent to **connectToServer** (**OpenMode**  mode). The socket is opened in the given **openMode** to the server defined by **setServerName** ().

        Note that unlike in most other **QIODevice**  subclasses, open() may not open the device directly. The function return false if the socket was already connected or if the server to connect to was not defined and true in any other case. The **connected** () or **errorOccurred** () signals will be emitted once the device is actualy open (or the connection failed).

        If the buffer size is limited to a certain size, **QLocalSocket**  won't buffer more than this size of data. Exceptionally, a buffer size of 0 means that the read buffer is unlimited and all incoming data is buffered. This is the default.

        This option is useful if you only read the data at certain points in time (e.g., in a real-time streaming application) or if you want to protect your socket against receiving too much data, which may eventually cause your application to run out of memory.

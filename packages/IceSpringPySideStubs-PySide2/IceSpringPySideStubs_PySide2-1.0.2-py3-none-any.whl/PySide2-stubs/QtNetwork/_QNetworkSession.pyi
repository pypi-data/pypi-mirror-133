    **Detailed Description**

    A QNetworkSession enables control over the system's network interfaces. The session's configuration parameter are determined via the **QNetworkConfiguration**  object to which it is bound. Depending on the type of the session (single access point or service network) a session may be linked to one or more network interfaces. By means of **opening**  and **closing**  of network sessions a developer can start and stop the systems network interfaces. If the configuration represents multiple access points (see **QNetworkConfiguration::ServiceNetwork** ) more advanced features such as roaming may be supported.

    QNetworkSession supports session management within the same process and depending on the platform's capabilities may support out-of-process sessions. If the same network configuration is used by multiple open sessions the underlying network interface is only terminated once the last session has been closed.

    **Roaming**

    Applications may connect to the **preferredConfigurationChanged** () signal in order to receive notifications when a more suitable access point becomes available. In response to this signal the application must either initiate the roaming via **migrate** () or **ignore** () the new access point. Once the session has roamed the **newConfigurationActivated** () signal is emitted. The application may now test the carrier and must either **accept** () or **reject** () it. The session will return to the previous access point if the roaming was rejected. The subsequent state diagram depicts the required state transitions.

    ![](images/roaming-states.png)

    Some platforms may distinguish forced roaming and application level roaming (ALR). ALR implies that the application controls (via **migrate** (), **ignore** (), **accept** () and **reject** ()) whether a network session can roam from one access point to the next. Such control is useful if the application maintains stateful socket connections and wants to control the transition from one interface to the next. Forced roaming implies that the system automatically roams to the next network without consulting the application. This has the advantage that the application can make use of roaming features without actually being aware of it. It is expected that the application detects that the underlying socket is broken and automatically reconnects via the new network link.

    If the platform supports both modes of roaming, an application indicates its preference by connecting to the **preferredConfigurationChanged** () signal. Connecting to this signal means that the application wants to take control over the roaming behavior and therefore implies application level roaming. If the client does not connect to the **preferredConfigurationChanged** (), forced roaming is used. If forced roaming is not supported the network session will not roam by default.

    Some applications may want to suppress any form of roaming altogether. Possible use cases may be high priority downloads or remote services which cannot handle a roaming enabled client. Clients can suppress roaming by connecting to the **preferredConfigurationChanged** () signal and answer each signal emission with **ignore** ().

        **QVariant QNetworkSession::sessionProperty(const QString & key ) const**

        Returns the value for property **key**.

        A network session can have properties attached which may describe the session in more details. This function can be used to gain access to those properties.

        The following property keys are guaranteed to be specified on all platforms:

        KeyDescription
        ActiveConfigurationIf the session **isOpen** () this property returns the identifier of the QNetworkConfiguration that is used by this session; otherwise an empty string.

        The main purpose of this key is to determine which Internet access point is used if the session is based on a **ServiceNetwork** . The following code snippet highlights the difference:



                **QNetworkConfigurationManager**  mgr;
                **QNetworkConfiguration**  ap = mgr.defaultConfiguration();
                **QNetworkSession**  *session = new **QNetworkSession** (ap);
                ... //code activates session

                **QString**  ident = session->sessionProperty("ActiveConfiguration").toString();
                if ( ap.type() == **QNetworkConfiguration** ::ServiceNetwork ) {
                    Q_ASSERT( ap.identifier() != ident );
                    Q_ASSERT( ap.children().contains( mgr.configurationFromIdentifier(ident) ) );
                } else if ( ap.type() == **QNetworkConfiguration** ::InternetAccessPoint ) {
                    Q_ASSERT( ap.identifier() == ident );
                }
                            \\endcode

        UserChoiceConfigurationIf the session **isOpen** () and is bound to a QNetworkConfiguration of type UserChoice, this property returns the identifier of the QNetworkConfiguration that the configuration resolved to when **open** () was called; otherwise an empty string.

        The purpose of this key is to determine the real QNetworkConfiguration that the session is using. This key is different from **ActiveConfiguration** in that this key may return an identifier for either a **service network**  or a **Internet access points**  configurations, whereas **ActiveConfiguration** always returns identifiers to **Internet access points**  configurations.

        ConnectInBackgroundSetting this property to **true** before calling **open** () implies that the connection attempt is made but if no connection can be established, the user is not connsulted and asked to select a suitable connection. This property is not set by default and support for it depends on the platform.
        AutoCloseSessionTimeoutIf the session requires polling to keep its state up to date, this property holds the timeout in milliseconds before the session will automatically close. If the value of this property is -1 the session will not automatically close. This property is set to -1 by default.

        The purpose of this property is to minimize resource use on platforms that use polling to update the state of the session. Applications can set the value of this property to the desired timeout before the session is closed. In response to the **closed** () signal the network session should be deleted to ensure that all polling is stopped. The session can then be recreated once it is required again. This property has no effect for sessions that do not require polling.

        Sets the property **value** on the session. The property is identified using **key**. Removing an already set property can be achieved by passing an invalid **QVariant** .

        Note that the **UserChoiceConfiguration** and **ActiveConfiguration** properties are read only and cannot be changed using this method.

        **QNetworkSession::State QNetworkSession::state() const**

        Returns the state of the session.

        If the session is based on a single access point configuration the state of the session is the same as the state of the associated network interface. Therefore a network session object can be used to monitor network interfaces.

        A **QNetworkConfiguration::ServiceNetwork**  based session summarizes the state of all its children and therefore returns the **Connected**  state if at least one of the service network's **children()**  configurations is active.

        Note that it is not required to hold an open session in order to obtain the network interface state. A connected but closed session may be used to monitor network interfaces whereas an open and connected session object may prevent the network interface from being shut down.

        **[signal] void QNetworkSession::preferredConfigurationChanged(const QNetworkConfiguration & config , bool isSeamless )**

        This signal is emitted when the preferred configuration/access point for the session changes. Only sessions which are based on service network configurations may emit this signal. **config** can be used to determine access point specific details such as proxy settings and **isSeamless** indicates whether roaming will break the sessions IP address.

        As a consequence to this signal the application must either start the roaming process by calling **migrate** () or choose to **ignore** () the new access point.

        If the roaming process is non-seamless the IP address will change which means that a socket becomes invalid. However seamless mobility can ensure that the local IP address does not change. This is achieved by using a virtual IP address which is bound to the actual link address. During the roaming process the virtual address is attached to the new link address.

        Some platforms may support the concept of Forced Roaming and Application Level Roaming (ALR). Forced roaming implies that the platform may simply roam to a new configuration without consulting applications. It is up to the application to detect the link layer loss and reestablish its sockets. In contrast ALR provides the opportunity to prevent the system from roaming. If this session is based on a configuration that supports roaming the application can choose whether it wants to be consulted (ALR use case) by connecting to this signal. For as long as this signal connection remains the session remains registered as a roaming stakeholder; otherwise roaming will be enforced by the platform.

    **Detailed Description**

    QQuickWindow provides the graphical scene management needed to interact with and display a scene of QQuickItems.

    A QQuickWindow always has a single invisible root item. To add items to this window, reparent the items to the root item or to an existing item in the scene.

    For easily displaying a scene from a QML file, see **QQuickView** .

    **Rendering**

    QQuickWindow uses a scene graph to represent what needs to be rendered. This scene graph is disconnected from the QML scene and potentially lives in another thread, depending on the platform implementation. Since the rendering scene graph lives independently from the QML scene, it can also be completely released without affecting the state of the QML scene.

    The **sceneGraphInitialized** () signal is emitted on the rendering thread before the QML scene is rendered to the screen for the first time. If the rendering scene graph has been released, the signal will be emitted again before the next frame is rendered.

    **Integration with OpenGL**

    When using the default OpenGL adaptation, it is possible to integrate OpenGL calls directly into the QQuickWindow using the same OpenGL context as the Qt Quick Scene Graph. This is done by connecting to the **QQuickWindow::beforeRendering** () or **QQuickWindow::afterRendering** () signal.

    **Note:** When using **QQuickWindow::beforeRendering** (), make sure to disable clearing before rendering with **QQuickWindow::setClearBeforeRendering** ().

    **Exposure and Visibility**

    When a QQuickWindow instance is deliberately hidden with **hide** () or **setVisible** (false), it will stop rendering and its scene graph and graphics context might be released. The **sceneGraphInvalidated** () signal will be emitted when this happens.

    **Warning:** It is crucial that graphics operations and interaction with the scene graph happens exclusively on the rendering thread, primarily during the updatePaintNode() phase.

    **Warning:** As signals related to rendering might be emitted from the rendering thread, connections should be made using **Qt::DirectConnection** .

    **Resource Management**

    QML will try to cache images and scene graph nodes to improve performance, but in some low-memory scenarios it might be required to aggressively release these resources. The **releaseResources** () can be used to force the clean up of certain resources. Calling **releaseResources** () may result in the entire scene graph and in the case of the OpenGL adaptation the associated context will be deleted. The **sceneGraphInvalidated** () signal will be emitted when this happens.

    **Note:** All classes with QSG prefix should be used solely on the scene graph's rendering thread. See **Scene Graph and Rendering**  for more information.

    **Context and Surface Formats**

    While it is possible to specify a **QSurfaceFormat**  for every QQuickWindow by calling the member function **setFormat** (), windows may also be created from QML by using the Window and **ApplicationWindow**  elements. In this case there is no C++ code involved in the creation of the window instance, yet applications may still wish to set certain surface format values, for example to request a given OpenGL version or profile. Such applications can call the static function **QSurfaceFormat::setDefaultFormat** () at startup. The specified format will be used for all Quick windows created afterwards.

        **void QQuickWindow::beginExternalCommands()**

        When mixing raw graphics (OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal, etc.) commands with scene graph rendering, it is necessary to call this function before recording commands to the command buffer used by the scene graph to render its main render pass. This is to avoid clobbering state.

        In practice this function is often called from a slot connected to the **beforeRenderPassRecording** () or **afterRenderPassRecording** () signals.

        The function does not need to be called when recording commands to the application's own command buffer (such as, a VkCommandBuffer or MTLCommandBuffer + MTLRenderCommandEncoder created and managed by the application, not retrieved from the scene graph). With graphics APIs where no native command buffer concept is exposed (OpenGL, Direct 3D 11), beginExternalCommands() and **endExternalCommands** () together provide a replacement for **resetOpenGLState** ().

        Calling this function and **endExternalCommands** () is not necessary within the **render()**  implementation of a **QSGRenderNode**  because the scene graph performs the necessary steps implicitly for render nodes.

        Native graphics objects (such as, graphics device, command buffer or encoder) are accessible via **QSGRendererInterface::getResource** ().

        **Warning:** Watch out for the fact that **QSGRendererInterface::CommandListResource**  may return a different object between beginExternalCommands() - **endExternalCommands** (). This can happen when the underlying implementation provides a dedicated secondary command buffer for recording external graphics commands within a render pass. Therefore, always query CommandListResource after calling this function. Do not attempt to reuse an object from an earlier query.

        **Note:** This function has no effect when the scene graph is using OpenGL directly and the RHI graphics abstraction layer is not in use. Refer to **resetOpenGLState** () in that case.

        **Note:** When the scenegraph is using the RHI graphics abstraction layer with the OpenGL backend underneath, pay attention to the fact that the OpenGL state in the context can have arbitrary settings, and this function does not perform any resetting of the state back to defaults. Call **resetOpenGLState** () if that is seen necessary.

        This function was introduced in Qt 5.14.

Other values from **CreateTextureOption**  are ignored.

        When **options** contains **TextureIsOpaque** , the engine will create an RGB texture which returns false for **QSGTexture::hasAlphaChannel** (). Opaque textures will in most cases be faster to render. When this flag is not set, the texture will have an alpha channel based on the image's format.

        When **options** contains **TextureHasMipmaps** , the engine will create a texture which can use mipmap filtering. Mipmapped textures can not be in an atlas.

        When using the OpenGL adaptation, the returned texture will be using `GL_TEXTURE_2D` as texture target and `GL_RGBA` as internal format. Reimplement **QSGTexture**  to create textures with different parameters.

        Creates a new **QSGTexture**  object from an existing native object.

        The native object is wrapped, but not owned, by the resulting **QSGTexture** . The caller of the function is responsible for deleting the returned **QSGTexture** , but that will not destroy the underlying native object.

        **type** specifies the type of the object. In practice the type is **NativeObjectTexture** , indicating that the native object is a texture or image of the underlying graphics API. Other types may be introduced in the future.

        This function is currently suitable for 2D RGBA textures only.

        Unlike createTextureFromId(), this function supports both direct OpenGL usage and the RHI abstracted rendering path.

        **Warning:** This function will return null if the scenegraph has not yet been initialized.

        Use **options** to customize the texture attributes. Only the **TextureHasAlphaChannel**  and **TextureHasMipmaps**  are taken into account here.

        **Warning:** Unlike createTextureFromId(), this function never takes ownership of the native object, and the **TextureOwnsGLTexture**  flag is ignored.

        **size** specifies the size in pixels.

        **nativeObjectPtr** is a pointer to the native object handle. With OpenGL, the native handle is a GLuint value, so **nativeObjectPtr** is then a pointer to a GLuint. With Vulkan, the native handle is a VkImage, so **nativeObjectPtr** is a pointer to a VkImage. With Direct3D 11 and Metal **nativeObjectPtr** is a pointer to a ID3D11Texture2D or MTLTexture pointer.

        **Note:** Pay attention to the fact that **nativeObjectPtr** is always a pointer to the native texture handle type, even if the native type itself is a pointer.

        **nativeLayout** is only used for APIs like Vulkan. When applicable, it must specify the current image layout, such as, a VkImageLayout value.

        The scene graph uses the OpenGL context and will both rely on and clobber its state. When mixing raw OpenGL commands with scene graph rendering, this function provides a convenient way of resetting the OpenGL context state back to its default values.

        This function does not touch state in the fixed-function pipeline.

        This function does not clear the color, depth and stencil buffers. Use **QQuickWindow::setClearBeforeRendering**  to control clearing of the color buffer. The depth and stencil buffer might be clobbered by the scene graph renderer. Clear these manually on demand.

        **Note:** This function only has an effect when using the default OpenGL scene graph adaptation.

        **Note:** This function will only reset the OpenGL context in relation to what has been changed internally as part of the OpenGL scene graph.

        The window takes ownership over **job** and will delete it when the job is completed.

        If rendering is shut down before **job** has a chance to run, the job will be run and then deleted as part of the scene graph cleanup. If the window is never shown and no rendering happens before the **QQuickWindow**  is destroyed, all pending jobs will be destroyed without their run() method being called.

        If the rendering is happening on a different thread, then the job will happen on the rendering thread.

        If **stage** is **NoStage** , **job** will be run at the earliest opportunity whenever the render thread is not busy rendering a frame. If there is no OpenGL context available or the window is not exposed at the time the job is either posted or handled, it is deleted without executing the run() method. If a non-threaded renderer is in use, the run() method of the job is executed synchronously. The OpenGL context is changed to the renderer context before executing a **NoStage**  job.

        This signal is applicable when using the RHI graphics abstraction with the scenegraph.

This allows inserting commands without having to generate an entire, separate render pass (which would typically clear the attached images). The native graphics objects can be queried via **QSGRendererInterface** .

        When not running with the RHI (and using OpenGL directly), the signal is emitted after the renderer has finished its rendering, but before **afterRendering** (). This makes it possible to create applications that function identically both with and without the RHI.

        **Note:** Resource updates (uploads, copies) typically cannot be enqueued from within a render pass. Therefore, more complex user rendering will need to connect to both **beforeRendering** () and this signal.

        **Warning:** This signal is emitted from the scene graph rendering thread. If your slot function needs to finish before execution continues, you must make sure that the connection is direct (see **Qt::ConnectionType** ).

        This function was introduced in Qt 5.14.

        This signal is emitted after the scene has completed rendering, before swapbuffers is called.

        This signal can be used to paint using raw OpenGL on top of QML content, or to do screen scraping of the current frame buffer.

        The OpenGL context used for rendering the scene graph will be bound at this point.

        When using the RHI, the signal is emitted after scene graph has added its commands to the command buffer, which is not yet submitted to the graphics queue. If desired, the slot function connected to this signal can query native resources, like the command buffer, before via **QSGRendererInterface** . Note however that the render pass (or passes) are already recorded at this point and it is not possible to add more commands within the scenegraph's pass. Instead, use **afterRenderPassRecording** () for that. This signal has therefore limited use and is rarely needed in an RHI-based setup. Rather, it is the combination of **beforeRendering** () + **beforeRenderPassRecording** () or **beforeRendering** () + **afterRenderPassRecording** () that is typically used to achieve under- or overlaying of the custom rendering.

        **Warning:** This signal is emitted from the scene graph rendering thread. If your slot function needs to finish before execution continues, you must make sure that the connection is direct (see **Qt::ConnectionType** ).

        **Warning:** Make very sure that a signal handler for afterRendering() leaves the OpenGL context in the same state as it was when the signal handler was entered. Failing to do so can result in the scene not rendering properly.

        This signal is emitted before the scenegraph starts recording commands for the main render pass. (Layers have their own passes and are fully recorded by the time this signal is emitted.) The render pass is already active on the command buffer when the signal is emitted.

        This signal is applicable when using the RHI graphics abstraction with the scenegraph. It is emitted later than **beforeRendering** () and it guarantees that not just the frame, but also the recording of the scenegraph's main render pass is active. This allows inserting commands without having to generate an entire, separate render pass (which would typically clear the attached images). The native graphics objects can be queried via **QSGRendererInterface** .

        When not running with the RHI (and using OpenGL directly), the signal is emitted after the renderer has cleared the render target. This makes it possible to create applications that function identically both with and without the RHI.

        Combined with the modes for clearing the background, this option can be used to paint using raw OpenGL under QML content.

        The OpenGL context used for rendering the scene graph will be bound at this point.

        When using the RHI, the signal is emitted after the preparations for the frame have been done, meaning there is a command buffer in recording mode, where applicable. If desired, the slot function connected to this signal can query native resources like the command before via **QSGRendererInterface** . Note however that the recording of the main render pass is not yet started at this point and it is not possible to add commands within that pass. Starting a pass means clearing the color, depth, and stencil buffers so it is not possible to achieve an underlay type of rendering by just connecting to this signal. Rather, connect to **beforeRenderPassRecording** (). However, connecting to this signal is still important if the recording of copy type of commands is desired since those cannot be enqueued within a render pass.

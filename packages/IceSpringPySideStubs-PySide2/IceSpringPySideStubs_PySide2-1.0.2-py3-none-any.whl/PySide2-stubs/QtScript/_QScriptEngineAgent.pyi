    **Detailed Description**

    The QScriptEngineAgent class is the basis of tools that monitor and/or control the execution of a **QScriptEngine** , such as debuggers and profilers.

    To process script loading and unloading events, reimplement the **scriptLoad** () and **scriptUnload** () functions. **scriptLoad** () is called after the input to **QScriptEngine::evaluate** () has been parsed, right before the given script is executed. The engine assigns each script an ID, which is available as one of the arguments to **scriptLoad** (); subsequently, other event handlers can use the ID to identify a particular script. One common usage of **scriptLoad** () is to retain the script text, filename and base line number (the original input to **QScriptEngine::evaluate** ()), so that other event handlers can e.g. map a line number to the corresponding line of text.

    **scriptUnload** () is called when the **QScriptEngine**  has no further use for a script; the QScriptEngineAgent may at this point safely discard any resources associated with the script (such as the script text). Note that after **scriptUnload** () has been called, the **QScriptEngine**  may reuse the relevant script ID for new scripts (i.e. as argument to a subsequent call to **scriptLoad** ()).

    Evaluating the following script will result in **scriptUnload** () being called immediately after evaluation has completed:

    var a = Math.random() + 2;

    Evaluating the following script will **not** result in a call to **scriptUnload** () when evaluation has completed:

    function cube(a) {
            return a * a * a;
        }

        var a = cube(3);

    The script isn't unloaded because it defines a function (`cube`) that remains in the script environment after evaluation has completed. If a subsequent script removed the `cube` function (e.g. by setting it to `null`), **scriptUnload** () would be called when the function is garbage collected. In general terms, a script isn't unloaded until the engine has determined that none of its contents is referenced.

    To process script function calls and returns, reimplement the **functionEntry** () and **functionExit** () functions. **functionEntry** () is called when a script function is about to be executed; **functionExit** () is called when a script function is about to return, either normally or due to an exception.

    To process individual script statements, reimplement **positionChange** (). **positionChange** () is called each time the engine is about to execute a new statement of a script, and thus offers the finest level of script monitoring.

    To process exceptions, reimplement **exceptionThrow** () and **exceptionCatch** (). **exceptionThrow** () is called when a script exception is thrown, before it has been handled. **exceptionCatch** () is called when an exception handler is present, and execution is about to be resumed at the handler code.

        This virtual function can be reimplemented in a **QScriptEngineAgent**  subclass to provide support for extensions. The optional **argument** can be provided as input to the **extension** ; the result must be returned in the form of a **QVariant** . You can call **supportsExtension** () to check if an extension is supported by the **QScriptEngineAgent** . By default, no extensions are supported, and this function returns an invalid **QVariant** .

        If you implement the **DebuggerInvocationRequest**  extension, Qt Script will call this function when a `debugger` statement is encountered in a script. The **argument** is a **QVariantList**  containing three items: The first item is the scriptId (a qint64), the second item is the line number (an int), and the third item is the column number (an int).

        This function is called when a script function is called in the engine. If the script function is not a native Qt Script function, it resides in the script identified by **scriptId** ; otherwise, **scriptId** is -1.

        This function is called just before execution of the script function begins. You can obtain the **QScriptContext**  associated with the function call with **QScriptEngine::currentContext** (). The arguments passed to the function are available.

        Reimplement this function to handle this event. For example, a debugger implementation could reimplement this function (and **functionExit** ()) to keep track of the call stack and provide step-over functionality.

        This function is called when the currently executing script function is about to return. If the script function is not a native Qt Script function, it resides in the script identified by **scriptId** ; otherwise, **scriptId** is -1. The **returnValue** is the value that the script function will return.

        If the engine's **hasUncaughtException** () function returns true, the script function is exiting due to an exception; otherwise, the script function is returning normally.

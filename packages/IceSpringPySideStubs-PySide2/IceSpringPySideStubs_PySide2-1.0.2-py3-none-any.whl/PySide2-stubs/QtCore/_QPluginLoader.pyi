    **Detailed Description**

    QPluginLoader provides access to a **Qt plugin** . A Qt plugin is stored in a shared library (a DLL) and offers these benefits over shared libraries accessed using **QLibrary** :

    * QPluginLoader checks that a plugin is linked against the same version of Qt as the application.
      * QPluginLoader provides direct access to a root component object (**instance** ()), instead of forcing you to resolve a C function manually.

    An instance of a QPluginLoader object operates on a single shared library file, which we call a plugin. It provides access to the functionality in the plugin in a platform-independent way. To specify which plugin to load, either pass a file name in the constructor or set it with **setFileName** ().

    The most important functions are **load** () to dynamically load the plugin file, **isLoaded** () to check whether loading was successful, and **instance** () to access the root component in the plugin. The **instance** () function implicitly tries to load the plugin if it has not been loaded yet. Multiple instances of QPluginLoader can be used to access the same physical plugin.

    Once loaded, plugins remain in memory until all instances of QPluginLoader has been unloaded, or until the application terminates. You can attempt to unload a plugin using **unload** (), but if other instances of QPluginLoader are using the same library, the call will fail, and unloading will only happen when every instance has called **unload** (). Right before the unloading happens, the root component will also be deleted.

    See **How to Create Qt Plugins**  for more information about how to make your application extensible through plugins.

    Note that the QPluginLoader cannot be used if your application is statically linked against Qt. In this case, you will also have to link to plugins statically. You can use **QLibrary**  if you need to load dynamic libraries in a statically linked application.

        This function was introduced in Qt 4.2.

        We recommend omitting the file's suffix in the file name, since **QPluginLoader**  will automatically look for the file with the appropriate suffix (see **QLibrary::isLibrary** ()).

        When loading the plugin, **QPluginLoader**  searches in all plugin locations specified by **QCoreApplication::libraryPaths** (), unless the file name has an absolute path. After loading the plugin successfully, fileName() returns the fully-qualified file name of the plugin, including the full path to the plugin if one was given in the constructor or passed to setFileName().

        If the file name does not exist, it will not be set. This property will then contain an empty string.

        By default, this property contains an empty string.

        **QObject *QPluginLoader::instance()**

        Returns the root component object of the plugin. The plugin is loaded if necessary. The function returns `nullptr` if the plugin could not be loaded or if the root component object could not be instantiated.

        If the root component object was destroyed, calling this function creates a new instance.

        The root component, returned by this function, is not deleted when the **QPluginLoader**  is destroyed. If you want to ensure that the root component is deleted, you should call **unload** () as soon you don't need to access the core component anymore. When the library is finally unloaded, the root component will automatically be deleted.

        The component object is a **QObject** . Use **qobject_cast** () to access interfaces you are interested in.

        **bool QPluginLoader::load()**

        Loads the plugin and returns `true` if the plugin was loaded successfully; otherwise returns `false`. Since **instance** () always calls this function before resolving any symbols it is not necessary to call it explicitly. In some situations you might want the plugin loaded in advance, in which case you would use this function.

        Returns the meta data for this plugin. The meta data is data specified in a json format using the **Q_PLUGIN_METADATA** () macro when compiling the plugin.

        The meta data can be queried in a fast and inexpensive way without actually loading the plugin. This makes it possible to e.g. store capabilities of the plugin in there, and make the decision whether to load the plugin dependent on this meta data.

    **Detailed Description**

    Timer events are sent at regular intervals to objects that have started one or more timers. Each timer has a unique identifier. A timer is started with **QObject::startTimer** ().

    The **QTimer**  class provides a high-level programming interface that uses signals instead of events. It also provides single-shot timers.

    The event handler **QObject::timerEvent** () receives timer events.

    **See also** **QTimer** , **QObject::timerEvent** (), **QObject::startTimer** (), and **QObject::killTimer** ().

        **QTimerEvent::QTimerEvent(int timerId )**

        Constructs a timer event object with the timer identifier set to **timerId**.

    **Detailed Description**

    In order to behave asynchronously and not introduce stutters or freezes in an application, the process of creating objects a QQmlIncubators must be driven only during the application's idle time. QQmlIncubationController allows the application to control exactly when, how often and for how long this processing occurs.

    A QQmlIncubationController derived instance should be created and set on a **QQmlEngine**  by calling the **QQmlEngine::setIncubationController** () method. Processing is then controlled by calling the **QQmlIncubationController::incubateFor** () or QQmlIncubationController::incubateWhile() methods as dictated by the application's requirements.

    For example, this is an example of a incubation controller that will incubate for a maximum of 5 milliseconds out of every 16 milliseconds.

    class PeriodicIncubationController : public **QObject** ,
                                             public QQmlIncubationController
        {
        public:
            PeriodicIncubationController() {
                startTimer(16);
            }

        protected:
            void timerEvent(**QTimerEvent**  *) override {
                incubateFor(5);
            }
        };

    Although the previous example would work, it is not optimal. Real world incubation controllers should try and maximize the amount of idle time they consume - rather than a static amount like 5 milliseconds - while not disturbing the application.

        **void QQmlIncubationController::incubateWhile(std::atomic<bool> * flag , int msecs = 0)**

        Incubate objects while the atomic bool pointed to by **flag** is true, or until there are no more objects to incubate, or up to **msecs** if **msecs** is not zero.

        Generally this method is used in conjunction with a thread or a UNIX signal that sets the bool pointed to by **flag** to false when it wants incubation to be interrupted.

        **Note:** **flag** is read using acquire memory ordering.

        This function was introduced in Qt 5.15.

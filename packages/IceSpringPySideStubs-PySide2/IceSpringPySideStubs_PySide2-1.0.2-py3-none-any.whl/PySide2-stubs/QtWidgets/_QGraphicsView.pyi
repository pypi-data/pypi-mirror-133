    **Detailed Description**

    QGraphicsView visualizes the contents of a **QGraphicsScene**  in a scrollable viewport. To create a scene with geometrical items, see **QGraphicsScene** \'s documentation. QGraphicsView is part of the **Graphics View Framework** .

    To visualize a scene, you start by constructing a QGraphicsView object, passing the address of the scene you want to visualize to QGraphicsView\'s constructor. Alternatively, you can call **setScene** () to set the scene at a later point. After you call **show** (), the view will by default scroll to the center of the scene and display any items that are visible at this point. For example:

    **QGraphicsScene**  scene;
        scene.addText("Hello, world!");

        **QGraphicsView**  view(&scene);
        view.show();

    You can explicitly scroll to any position on the scene by using the scroll bars, or by calling **centerOn** (). By passing a point to **centerOn** (), QGraphicsView will scroll its viewport to ensure that the point is centered in the view. An overload is provided for scrolling to a **QGraphicsItem** , in which case QGraphicsView will see to that the center of the item is centered in the view. If all you want is to ensure that a certain area is visible, (but not necessarily centered,) you can call **ensureVisible** () instead.

    QGraphicsView can be used to visualize a whole scene, or only parts of it. The visualized area is by default detected automatically when the view is displayed for the first time (by calling **QGraphicsScene::itemsBoundingRect** ()). To set the visualized area rectangle yourself, you can call **setSceneRect** (). This will adjust the scroll bars\' ranges appropriately. Note that although the scene supports a virtually unlimited size, the range of the scroll bars will never exceed the range of an integer (INT_MIN, INT_MAX).

    QGraphicsView visualizes the scene by calling **render** (). By default, the items are drawn onto the viewport by using a regular **QPainter** , and using default render hints. To change the default render hints that QGraphicsView passes to **QPainter**  when painting items, you can call **setRenderHints** ().

    By default, QGraphicsView provides a regular **QWidget**  for the viewport widget. You can access this widget by calling **viewport** (), or you can replace it by calling **setViewport** (). To render using OpenGL, simply call **setViewport** (new **QOpenGLWidget** ). QGraphicsView takes ownership of the viewport widget.

    QGraphicsView supports affine transformations, using **QTransform** . You can either pass a matrix to **setTransform** (), or you can call one of the convenience functions **rotate** (), **scale** (), **translate** () or **shear** (). The most two common transformations are scaling, which is used to implement zooming, and rotation. QGraphicsView keeps the center of the view fixed during a transformation. Because of the scene alignment (setAligment()), translating the view will have no visual impact.

    You can interact with the items on the scene by using the mouse and keyboard. QGraphicsView translates the mouse and key events into **scene** events, (events that inherit **QGraphicsSceneEvent** ,), and forward them to the visualized scene. In the end, it\'s the individual item that handles the events and reacts to them. For example, if you click on a selectable item, the item will typically let the scene know that it has been selected, and it will also redraw itself to display a selection rectangle. Similiary, if you click and drag the mouse to move a movable item, it\'s the item that handles the mouse moves and moves itself. Item interaction is enabled by default, and you can toggle it by calling **setInteractive** ().

    You can also provide your own custom scene interaction, by creating a subclass of QGraphicsView, and reimplementing the mouse and key event handlers. To simplify how you programmatically interact with items in the view, QGraphicsView provides the mapping functions **mapToScene** () and **mapFromScene** (), and the item accessors **items** () and **itemAt** (). These functions allow you to map points, rectangles, polygons and paths between view coordinates and scene coordinates, and to find items on the scene using view coordinates.

    **Note:** Using an OpenGL viewport limits the ability to use **QGraphicsProxyWidget** . Not all combinations of widgets and styles can be supported with such a setup. You should carefully test your UI and make the necessary adjustments.

        **alignment : Qt::Alignment**

        This property holds the alignment of the scene in the view when the whole scene is visible.

        If the whole scene is visible in the view, (i.e., there are no visible scroll bars,) the view's alignment will decide where the scene will be rendered in the view. For example, if the alignment is **Qt::AlignCenter** , which is default, the scene will be centered in the view, and if the alignment is (**Qt::AlignLeft**  | **Qt::AlignTop** ), the scene will be rendered in the top-left corner of the view.

        **backgroundBrush : QBrush**

        This property holds the background brush of the scene.

        This property sets the background brush for the scene in this view. It is used to override the scene's own background, and defines the behavior of **drawBackground** (). To provide custom background drawing for this view, you can reimplement **drawBackground** () instead.

        By default, this property contains a brush with the **Qt::NoBrush**  pattern.

        **cacheMode : CacheMode**

        This property holds which parts of the view are cached

        **QGraphicsView**  can cache pre-rendered content in a **QPixmap** , which is then drawn onto the viewport. The purpose of such caching is to speed up the total rendering time for areas that are slow to render. Texture, gradient and alpha blended backgrounds, for example, can be notibly slow to render; especially with a transformed view. The **CacheBackground**  flag enables caching of the view\'s background. For example:

        **QGraphicsView**  view;
            view.setBackgroundBrush(**QImage** (":/images/backgroundtile.png"));
            view.setCacheMode(**QGraphicsView** ::CacheBackground);

        The cache is invalidated every time the view is transformed. However, when scrolling, only partial invalidation is required.

        By default, nothing is cached.

        **Access functions:**

        QGraphicsView::CacheMode **cacheMode** () const
        void **setCacheMode** (QGraphicsView::CacheMode **mode** )

        **void QGraphicsView::fitInView(const QRectF & rect , Qt::AspectRatioMode aspectRatioMode = Qt::IgnoreAspectRatio)**

        Scales the view matrix and scrolls the scroll bars to ensure that the scene rectangle **rect** fits inside the viewport. **rect** must be inside the scene rect; otherwise, fitInView() cannot guarantee that the whole rect is visible.

        This function keeps the view's rotation, translation, or shear. The view is scaled according to **aspectRatioMode**. **rect** will be centered in the view if it does not fit tightly.

        It's common to call fitInView() from inside a reimplementation of **resizeEvent** (), to ensure that the whole scene, or parts of the scene, scales automatically to fit the new size of the viewport as the view is resized. Note though, that calling fitInView() from inside **resizeEvent** () can lead to unwanted resize recursion, if the new transformation toggles the automatic state of the scrollbars. You can toggle the scrollbar policies to always on or always off to prevent this (see **horizontalScrollBarPolicy** () and **verticalScrollBarPolicy** ()).

        If **rect** is empty, or if the viewport is too small, this function will do nothing.

        **QGraphicsView**  can cache pre-rendered content in a **QPixmap** , which is then drawn onto the viewport. The purpose of such caching is to speed up the total rendering time for areas that are slow to render. Texture, gradient and alpha blended backgrounds, for example, can be notibly slow to render; especially with a transformed view. The **CacheBackground**  flag enables caching of the view\'s background. For example:

        **void QGraphicsView::setTransform(const QTransform & matrix , bool combine = false)**

        Sets the view\'s current transformation matrix to **matrix**.

        If **combine** is true, then **matrix** is combined with the current matrix; otherwise, **matrix** **replaces** the current matrix. **combine** is false by default.

        The transformation matrix tranforms the scene into view coordinates. Using the default transformation, provided by the identity matrix, one pixel in the view represents one unit in the scene (e.g., a 10x10 rectangular item is drawn using 10x10 pixels in the view). If a 2x2 scaling matrix is applied, the scene will be drawn in 1:2 (e.g., a 10x10 rectangular item is then drawn using 20x20 pixels in the view).

        Example:

        **QGraphicsScene**  scene;
            scene.addText("GraphicsView rotated clockwise");

            **QGraphicsView**  view(&scene);

            view.show();

        To simplify interation with items using a transformed view, **QGraphicsView**  provides **mapTo** ... and **mapFrom** ... functions that can translate between scene and view coordinates. For example, you can call **mapToScene** () to map a view coordiate to a floating point scene coordinate, or **mapFromScene** () to map from floating point scene coordinates to view coordinates.

    **Detailed Description**

    When a **QGraphicsView**  receives Qt mouse, keyboard, and drag and drop
    events (**QMouseEvent** , **QKeyEvent** , QDragEvent, etc.), it translates
    them into instances of QGraphicsSceneEvent subclasses and forwards them to
    the **QGraphicsScene**  it displays. The scene then forwards the events to
    the relevant items.

    For example, when a **QGraphicsView**  receives a **QMouseEvent**  of type
    MousePress as a response to a user click, the view sends a
    **QGraphicsSceneMouseEvent**  of type **GraphicsSceneMousePress**  to the
    underlying **QGraphicsScene**  through its **mousePressEvent()**  function.
    The default **QGraphicsScene::mousePressEvent** () implementation determines
    which item was clicked and forwards the event to
    **QGraphicsItem::mousePressEvent** ().

    Subclasses such as **QGraphicsSceneMouseEvent**  and
    **QGraphicsSceneContextMenuEvent**  provide the coordinates from the
    original **QEvent**  in screen, scene, and item coordinates (see
    **screenPos()** , **scenePos()** , and **pos()** ). The item coordinates are
    set by the **QGraphicsScene**  before it forwards the event to the event to
    a **QGraphicsItem** . The mouse events also add the possibility to retrieve
    the coordinates from the last event received by the view (see
    **lastScreenPos()** , **lastScenePos()** , and **lastPos()** ).

    **See also** **QEvent** .

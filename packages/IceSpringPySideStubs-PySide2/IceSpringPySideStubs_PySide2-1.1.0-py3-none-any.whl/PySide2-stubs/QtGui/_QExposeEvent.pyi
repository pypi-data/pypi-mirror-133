    **Detailed Description**

    Expose events are sent to windows when an area of the window is invalidated,
    for example when window exposure in the windowing system changes.

    A Window with a client area that is completely covered by another window, or
    is otherwise not visible may be considered obscured by Qt and may in such
    cases not receive expose events.

    The event handler **QWindow::exposeEvent** () receives expose events.

        **QExposeEvent::QExposeEvent(const QRegion & exposeRegion )**

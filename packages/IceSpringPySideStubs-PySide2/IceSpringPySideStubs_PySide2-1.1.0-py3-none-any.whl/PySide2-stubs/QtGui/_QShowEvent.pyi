    **Detailed Description**

    There are two kinds of show events: show events caused by the window system
    (spontaneous), and internal show events. Spontaneous
    (**QEvent::spontaneous** ()) show events are sent just after the window
    system shows the window; they are also sent when a top-level window is
    redisplayed after being iconified. Internal show events are delivered just
    before the widget becomes visible.

    **See also** **QHideEvent** .

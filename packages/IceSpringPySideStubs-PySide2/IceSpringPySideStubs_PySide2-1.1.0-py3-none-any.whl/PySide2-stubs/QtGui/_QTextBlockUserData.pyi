    **Detailed Description**

    QTextBlockUserData provides an abstract interface for container classes that
    are used to associate application-specific user data with text blocks in a
    **QTextDocument** .

    Generally, subclasses of this class provide functions to allow data to be
    stored and retrieved, and instances are attached to blocks of text using
    **QTextBlock::setUserData** (). This makes it possible to store additional
    data per text block in a way that can be retrieved safely by the
    application.

    Each subclass should provide a reimplementation of the destructor to ensure
    that any private data is automatically cleaned up when user data objects are
    deleted.

    **Detailed Description**

    The QPlaceIdReply can be considered a multipurpose reply in that it can be
    used to save places, save categories, remove places and remove categories.
    In each case it returns an identifier of the place or category that was
    added, modified or removed.

    See **Saving a place**  for an example of how to use an identifier reply.

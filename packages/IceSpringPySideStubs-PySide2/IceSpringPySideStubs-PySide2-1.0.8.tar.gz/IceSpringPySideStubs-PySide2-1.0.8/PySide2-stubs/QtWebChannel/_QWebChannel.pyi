    **Detailed Description**

    The QWebChannel fills the gap between C++ applications and HTML/JavaScript
    applications. By publishing a **QObject**  derived object to a QWebChannel
    and using the **qwebchannel.js**  on the HTML side, one can transparently
    access properties and public slots and methods of the **QObject** . No
    manual message passing and serialization of data is required, property
    updates and signal emission on the C++ side get automatically transmitted to
    the potentially remotely running HTML clients. On the client side, a
    JavaScript object will be created for any published C++ **QObject** . It
    mirrors the C++ object's API and thus is intuitively useable.

    The C++ QWebChannel API makes it possible to talk to any HTML client, which
    could run on a local or even remote machine. The only limitation is that the
    HTML client supports the JavaScript features used by `qwebchannel.js`. As
    such, one can interact with basically any modern HTML browser or standalone
    JavaScript runtime, such as node.js.

    There also exists a declarative **WebChannel API** .

    **See also** **Qt WebChannel Standalone Example**  and **JavaScript API** .

        **QWebChannel::QWebChannel(QObject * parent = Q_NULLPTR)**

        Constructs the QWebChannel object with the given **parent**.

        Note that a QWebChannel is only fully operational once you connect it to
        a **QWebChannelAbstractTransport** . The HTML clients also need to be
        setup appropriately using [`qwebchannel.js`** .

        **blockUpdates : bool**

        When set to true, updates are blocked and remote clients will not be
        notified about property changes.

        The changes are recorded and sent to the clients once updates become
        unblocked again by setting this property to false. By default, updates
        are not blocked.

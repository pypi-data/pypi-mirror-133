    **Detailed Description**

    The QSGBasicGeometryNode class should not be used by itself. It is only encapsulates shared functionality between the **QSGGeometryNode**  and **QSGClipNode**  classes.

    **Note:** All classes with QSG prefix should be used solely on the scene graph's rendering thread. See **Scene Graph and Rendering**  for more information.

        **void QSGBasicGeometryNode::setGeometry(QSGGeometry * geometry )**

        Sets the geometry of this node to **geometry**.

        If the node has the flag **QSGNode::OwnsGeometry**  set, it will also delete the geometry object it is pointing to. This flag is not set by default.

        If the geometry is changed without calling setGeometry() again, the user must also mark the geometry as dirty using **QSGNode::markDirty** ().

        **See also** **geometry** () and **markDirty** ().

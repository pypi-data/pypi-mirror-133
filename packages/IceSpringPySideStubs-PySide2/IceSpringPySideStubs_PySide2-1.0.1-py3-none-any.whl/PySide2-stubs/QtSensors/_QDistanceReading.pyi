    """
    **Detailed Description**

    The QDistanceReading class holds distance reading in cm from the proximity sensor. Note: Some proximity sensor only support two values for distance, a near and far value. In this case, the sensor should report its maximum range value to represent the far state, and a lesser value to represent the near state.

    **QDistanceReading Units**

    The distance is measured in cm

    The distance sensor is typically located in the front face of a device, and thus will measure the distance of an object from the device's front face.

    **Detailed Description**

    The only behavioural difference is that this class sets the type properly.

    This class also features a **reading** () function that returns a **QLightReading**  instead of a **QSensorReading** .

    For details about how the sensor works, see **QLightReading** .

    **See also** **QLightReading** .

        **QLightSensor::QLightSensor(QObject * parent = Q_NULLPTR)**

        Construct the sensor as a child of **parent**.

        **fieldOfView : const qreal**

        This property holds a value indicating the field of view.

        This is an angle that represents the field of view of the sensor.

        Not all light sensor support retrieving their field of view. For sensors that don't support this property, the value will be 0. Whether the field of view is supported can be checked with **QSensor::isFeatureSupported** () and the **QSensor::FieldOfView**  flag.

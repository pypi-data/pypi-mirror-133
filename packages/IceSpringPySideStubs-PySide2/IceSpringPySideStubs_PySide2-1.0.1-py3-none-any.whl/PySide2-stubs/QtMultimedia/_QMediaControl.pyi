class QMediaControl(PySide2.QtCore.QObject):
    """
    **Detailed Description**

    Media controls provide an interface to individual features provided by a media service. Most services implement a principal control which exposes the core functionality of the service and a number of optional controls which expose any additional functionality.

    A pointer to a control implemented by a media service can be obtained using the **QMediaService::requestControl** () member of **QMediaService** . If the service doesn\'t implement a control it will instead return a null pointer.

    **QMediaPlayerControl**  *control = qobject_cast<**QMediaPlayerControl**  *>(
                mediaService->requestControl("org.qt-project.qt.mediaplayercontrol/5.0"));

    Alternatively if the IId of the control has been declared using **Q_MEDIA_DECLARE_CONTROL**  the template version of **QMediaService::requestControl** () can be used to request the service without explicitly passing the IId or using **qobject_cast** ().

    **QMediaPlayerControl**  *control = mediaService->requestControl<**QMediaPlayerControl**  *>();

    Most application code will not interface directly with a media service\'s controls, instead the **QMediaObject**  which owns the service acts as an intermediary between one or more controls and the application.

    **See also** **QMediaService**  and **QMediaObject** .

class QReadLocker(object):
    """
    **Detailed Description**

    The purpose of QReadLocker (and **QWriteLocker** ) is to simplify **QReadWriteLock**  locking and unlocking. Locking and unlocking statements or in exception handling code is error-prone and difficult to debug. QReadLocker can be used in such situations to ensure that the state of the lock is always well-defined.

    Here's an example that uses QReadLocker to lock and unlock a read-write lock for reading:

    **QReadWriteLock**  lock;

        **QByteArray**  readData()
        {
            **QReadLocker**  locker(&lock);
            ...
            return data;
        }

    It is equivalent to the following code:

    **QReadWriteLock**  lock;

        **QByteArray**  readData()
        {
            lock.lockForRead();
            ...
            lock.unlock();
            return data;
        }

    The **QMutexLocker**  documentation shows examples where the use of a locker object greatly simplifies programming.

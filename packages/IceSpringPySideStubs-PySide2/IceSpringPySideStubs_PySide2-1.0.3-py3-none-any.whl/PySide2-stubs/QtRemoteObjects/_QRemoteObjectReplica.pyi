    **Detailed Description**

    A Remote Object Replica is a **QObject**  proxy for another **QObject**  (called the **Source**  object). Once initialized, a replica can be considered a "latent copy" of the **Source**  object. That is, every change to a **Q_PROPERTY**  on the **Source** , or signal emitted by the **Source**  will be updated/emitted by all **Replica**  objects. Latency is introduced by process scheduling by any OSes involved and network communication latency. As long as the replica has been initialized and the communication is not disrupted, receipt and order of changes is guaranteed.

    The **isInitialized**  and **state**  properties (and corresponding **initialized** ()/**stateChanged** () signals) allow the state of a **Replica**  to be determined.

    While Qt Remote Objects (QtRO) handles the initialization and synchronization of **Replica**  objects, there are numerous steps happening behind the scenes which can fail and that aren\'t encountered in single process Qt applications. See **Troubleshooting**  for advice on how to handle such issues when using a remote objects network.

        **[signal] void QRemoteObjectReplica::notified()**

        This signal is emitted once the replica is initialized and all property change notifications have been emitted.

        It is sometimes useful to respond to property changes as events. For example, you might want to display a user notification when a certain property change occurs. However, this user notification would then also be triggered when a replica first became `QRemoteObjectReplica::Valid`, as all property change signals are emitted at that time. This isn't always desirable, and `notified` allows the developer to distinguish between these two cases.

        **[signal] void QRemoteObjectReplica::stateChanged(QRemoteObjectReplica::State state , QRemoteObjectReplica::State oldState )**

        This signal is emitted whenever a replica's state toggles between **QRemoteObjectReplica::State** .

        The change in state is represented with **state** and **oldState**.

        **Note:** Notifier signal for property **state** .

    **Detailed Description**

    The QRemoteObjectRegistryHost class provides an entry point to a **QtRemoteObjects**  network. A network can be as simple as two Nodes, or an arbitrarily complex set of processes and devices.

    A QRemoteObjectRegistryHost has the same capability that a **QRemoteObjectHost**  has (which includes everything a **QRemoteObjectNode**  supports), and in addition is the owner of the Registry. Any **QRemoteObjectHost**  node that connects to this Node will have all of their Source objects made available by the Registry.

    Nodes only support connection to one **registry** , calling **QRemoteObjectNode::setRegistryUrl**  when a Registry is already set is considered an error. For something like a secure and insecure network (where different Registries would be applicable), the recommendation is to create separate Nodes to connect to each, in effect creating two independent Qt Remote Objects networks.

    Nodes may connect to each other directly using **connectToNode** , or they can use the **QRemoteObjectRegistry**  to simplify connections.

    The **QRemoteObjectRegistry**  is a special Replica available to every Node that connects to the Registry Url. It knows how to connect to every QRemoteObjectSource object on the network.

        **QRemoteObjectRegistryHost::QRemoteObjectRegistryHost(const QUrl & registryAddress = QUrl(), QObject * parent = nullptr)**

        Constructs a new QRemoteObjectRegistryHost Node with the given **parent**. RegistryHost Nodes have the same functionality as **QRemoteObjectHost**  Nodes, except rather than being able to connect to a **QRemoteObjectRegistry** , the provided Host **QUrl**  ( **registryAddress** ) becomes the address of the registry for other Nodes to connect to.

        **[override virtual] bool QRemoteObjectRegistryHost::setRegistryUrl(const QUrl & registryUrl )**

        Reimplements an access function for property: **QRemoteObjectNode::registryUrl** .

        This method can be used to set the address of this Node to **registryUrl** (used for other Nodes to connect to this one), if the **QUrl**  isn't set in the constructor. Since this Node becomes the Registry, calling this setter method causes this Node to use the url as the host address. All other Node's use the **QRemoteObjectNode::setRegistryUrl**  method initiate a connection to the Registry.

        Returns `true` if the registry address is set, otherwise `false`.

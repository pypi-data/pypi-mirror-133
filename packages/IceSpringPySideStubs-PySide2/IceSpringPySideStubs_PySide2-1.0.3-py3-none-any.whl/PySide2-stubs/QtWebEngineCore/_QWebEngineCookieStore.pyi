    **Detailed Description**

    The class allows to access HTTP cookies of Chromium for a specific profile. It can be used to synchronize cookies of Chromium and the **QNetworkAccessManager** , as well as to set, delete, and intercept cookies during navigation. Because cookie operations are asynchronous, the user can choose to provide a callback function to get notified about the success of the operation. The signal handlers for removal and addition should not be used to execute heavy tasks, because they might block the IO thread in case of a blocking connection.

    Use **QWebEngineProfile::cookieStore** () and **QQuickWebEngineProfile::cookieStore** () to access the cookie store object for a specific profile.

        Deletes **cookie** from the cookie store. It is possible to provide an optional **origin** URL argument to limit the scope of the cookie to be deleted.

        **void QWebEngineCookieStore::loadAllCookies()**

        Loads all the cookies into the cookie store. The **cookieAdded** () signal is emitted on every loaded cookie. Cookies are loaded automatically when the store gets initialized, which in most cases happens on loading the first URL. However, calling this function is useful if cookies should be listed before entering the web content.

        Adds **cookie** to the cookie store.

        **Note:** If **cookie** specifies a **QNetworkCookie::domain** () that does not start with a dot, a dot is automatically prepended. To limit the cookie to the exact server, omit **QNetworkCookie::domain** () and set **origin** instead.

        The provided URL should also include the scheme.

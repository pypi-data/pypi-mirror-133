    **Detailed Description**

    Many pieces of information are established when Qt is configured and built. This class provides an abstraction for accessing that information. By using the static functions of this class, an application can obtain information about the instance of the Qt library which the application is using at run-time.

    You can also use a `qt.conf` file to override the hard-coded paths that are compiled into the Qt library. For more information, see the **Using qt.conf**  documentation.

    **See also** **QSysInfo**  and **Using qt.conf** .

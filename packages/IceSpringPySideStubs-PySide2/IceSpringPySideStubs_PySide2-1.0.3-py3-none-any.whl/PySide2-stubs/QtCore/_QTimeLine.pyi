    **Detailed Description**

    It\'s most commonly used to animate a GUI control by calling a slot periodically. You can construct a timeline by passing its duration in milliseconds to QTimeLine\'s constructor. The timeline\'s duration describes for how long the animation will run. Then you set a suitable frame range by calling **setFrameRange** (). Finally connect the **frameChanged** () signal to a suitable slot in the widget you wish to animate (for example, **setValue()**  in **QProgressBar** ). When you proceed to calling **start** (), QTimeLine will enter Running state, and start emitting **frameChanged** () at regular intervals, causing your widget\'s connected property\'s value to grow from the lower end to the upper and of your frame range, at a steady rate. You can specify the update interval by calling **setUpdateInterval** (). When done, QTimeLine enters **NotRunning**  state, and emits **finished** ().

    Example:

    ...
        progressBar = new **QProgressBar** (this);
        progressBar->setRange(0, 100);

        // Construct a 1-second timeline with a frame range of 0 - 100
        **QTimeLine**  *timeLine = new **QTimeLine** (1000, this);
        timeLine->setFrameRange(0, 100);
        connect(timeLine, &**QTimeLine** ::frameChanged, progressBar, &**QProgressBar** ::setValue);

        // Clicking the push button will start the progress bar animation
        pushButton = new **QPushButton** (tr("Start animation"), this);
        connect(pushButton, &**QPushButton** ::clicked, timeLine, &**QTimeLine** ::start);
        ...

    By default the timeline runs once, from its beginning to its end, upon which you must call **start** () again to restart from the beginning. To make the timeline loop, you can call **setLoopCount** (), passing the number of times the timeline should run before finishing. The direction can also be changed, causing the timeline to run backward, by calling **setDirection** (). You can also pause and unpause the timeline while it\'s running by calling **setPaused** (). For interactive control, the **setCurrentTime** () function is provided, which sets the time position of the time line directly. Although most useful in **NotRunning**  state (e.g., connected to a **valueChanged** () signal in a **QSlider** ), this function can be called at any time.

    The frame interface is useful for standard widgets, but QTimeLine can be used to control any type of animation. The heart of QTimeLine lies in the **valueForTime** () function, which generates a **value** between 0 and 1 for a given time. This value is typically used to describe the steps of an animation, where 0 is the first step of an animation, and 1 is the last step. When running, QTimeLine generates values between 0 and 1 by calling **valueForTime** () and emitting **valueChanged** (). By default, **valueForTime** () applies an interpolation algorithm to generate these value. You can choose from a set of predefined timeline algorithms by calling **setEasingCurve** ().

    Note that, by default, QTimeLine uses **QEasingCurve::InOutSine** , which provides a value that grows slowly, then grows steadily, and finally grows slowly. For a custom timeline, you can reimplement **valueForTime** (), in which case QTimeLine\'s **easingCurve**  property is ignored.

    **Detailed Description**

    The MIME type database is provided by the freedesktop.org shared-mime-info project. If the MIME type database cannot be found on the system, as is the case on most Windows, macOS, and iOS systems, Qt will use its own copy of it.

    Applications which want to define custom MIME types need to install an XML file into the locations searched for MIME definitions. These locations can be queried with

    **QStandardPaths** ::locateAll(**QStandardPaths** ::GenericDataLocation, QLatin1String("mime/packages"),
                                  **QStandardPaths** ::LocateDirectory);

    On a typical Unix system, this will be /usr/share/mime/packages/, but it is also possible to extend the list of directories by setting the environment variable `XDG_DATA_DIRS`. For instance adding /opt/myapp/share to `XDG_DATA_DIRS` will result in /opt/myapp/share/mime/packages/ being searched for MIME definitions.

    Here is an example of MIME XML:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <mime-info xmlns="http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info">
          <mime-type type="application/vnd.qt.qmakeprofile">
            <comment xml:lang="en">Qt qmake Profile</comment>
            <glob pattern="*.pro" weight="50"/>
          </mime-type>
        </mime-info>

    For more details about the syntax of XML MIME definitions, including defining "magic" in order to detect MIME types based on data as well, read the Shared Mime Info specification at http://standards.freedesktop.org/shared-mime-info-spec/shared-mime-info-spec-latest.html

    On Unix systems, a binary cache is used for more performance. This cache is generated by the command "update-mime-database path", where path would be /opt/myapp/share/mime in the above example. Make sure to run this command when installing the MIME type definition file.

    QMimeDatabase db;
        **QMimeType**  mime = db.mimeTypeForFile(fileName);
        if (mime.inherits("text/plain")) {
            // The file is plain text, we can display it in a QTextEdit
        }

        **QMimeDatabase::QMimeDatabase()**

        Constructs a QMimeDatabase object.

        It is perfectly OK to create an instance of QMimeDatabase every time you need to perform a lookup. The parsing of mimetypes is done on demand (when shared-mime-info is installed) or when the very first instance is constructed (when parsing XML files directly).

        **QList<QMimeType> QMimeDatabase::allMimeTypes() const**

        Returns the list of all available MIME types.

        This can be useful for showing all MIME types to the user, for instance in a MIME type editor. Do not use unless really necessary in other cases though, prefer using the **mimeTypeForXxx()**  methods for performance reasons.

        The default matching algorithm looks at both the file name and the file contents, if necessary. The file extension has priority over the contents, but the contents will be used if the file extension is unknown, or matches multiple MIME types. If **fileInfo** is a Unix symbolic link, the file that it refers to will be used instead. If the file doesn't match any known pattern or data, the default MIME type (application/octet-stream) is returned.

        When **mode** is set to **MatchExtension** , only the file name is used, not the file contents. The file doesn't even have to exist. If the file name doesn't match any known pattern, the default MIME type (application/octet-stream) is returned. If multiple MIME types match this file, the first one (alphabetically) is returned.

        When **mode** is set to **MatchContent** , and the file is readable, only the file contents are used to determine the MIME type. This is equivalent to calling **mimeTypeForData**  with a **QFile**  as input device.

        **fileInfo** may refer to an absolute or relative path.

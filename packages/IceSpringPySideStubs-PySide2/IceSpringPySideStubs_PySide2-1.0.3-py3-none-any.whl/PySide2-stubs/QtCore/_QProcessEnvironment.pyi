    **Detailed Description**

    A process's environment is composed of a set of key=value pairs known as environment variables. The QProcessEnvironment class wraps that concept and allows easy manipulation of those variables. It's meant to be used along with **QProcess** , to set the environment for child processes. It cannot be used to change the current process's environment.

    The environment of the calling process can be obtained using **QProcessEnvironment::systemEnvironment** ().

    On Unix systems, the variable names are case-sensitive. Note that the Unix environment allows both variable names and contents to contain arbitrary binary data (except for the NUL character). QProcessEnvironment will preserve such variables, but does not support manipulating variables whose names or values cannot be encoded by the current locale settings (see **QTextCodec::codecForLocale** ).

    On Windows, the variable names are case-insensitive, but case-preserving. QProcessEnvironment behaves accordingly.

    **See also** **QProcess** , **QProcess::systemEnvironment** (), and **QProcess::setProcessEnvironment** ().

        **[static] QProcessEnvironment QProcessEnvironment::systemEnvironment()**

        The systemEnvironment function returns the environment of the calling process.

        It is returned as a **QProcessEnvironment** . This function does not cache the system environment. Therefore, it's possible to obtain an updated version of the environment if low-level C library functions like `setenv` or `putenv` have been called.

        However, note that repeated calls to this function will recreate the **QProcessEnvironment**  object, which is a non-trivial operation.

        This function was introduced in Qt 4.6.

        Converts this **QProcessEnvironment**  object into a list of strings, one for each environment variable that is set. The environment variable's name and its value are separated by an equal character ('=').

        The **QStringList**  contents returned by this function are suitable for presentation. Use with the QProcess::setEnvironment function is not recommended due to potential encoding problems under Unix, and worse performance.

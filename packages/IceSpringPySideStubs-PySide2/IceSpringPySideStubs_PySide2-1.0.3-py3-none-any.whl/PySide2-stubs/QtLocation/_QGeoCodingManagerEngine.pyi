    **Detailed Description**

    In the default implementation, supportsGeocoding() and supportsReverseGeocoding() returns false while **geocode** () and **reverseGeocode** () cause **QGeoCodeReply::UnsupportedOptionError**  to occur.

    If the service provider supports geocoding the subclass should provide an implementation of **geocode** () and call setSupportsGeocoding(true) at some point in time before **geocode** () is called.

    Similarly, if the service provider supports reverse geocoding the subclass should provide an implementation **reverseGeocode** () and call setSupportsReverseGeocoding(true) at some point in time before **reverseGeocode** () is called.

    A subclass of QGeoCodingManagerEngine will often make use of a subclass fo **QGeoCodeReply**  internally, in order to add any engine-specific data (such as a **QNetworkReply**  object for network-based services) to the **QGeoCodeReply**  instances used by the engine.

    **See also** **QGeoCodingManager** .

        Once the operation has completed, **QGeoCodeReply::locations** () can be used to retrieve the results, which will consist of a list of **QGeoLocation**  objects. These objects represent a combination of coordinate and address data.

        The address data returned in the results may be different from **address**. This will usually occur if the geocoding service backend uses a different canonical form of addresses or if **address** was only partially filled out.

        If **bounds** is non-null and a valid **QGeoShape**  it will be used to limit the results to those that are contained by **bounds**. This is particularly useful if **address** is only partially filled out, as the service will attempt to geocode all matches for the specified data.

        Begins the reverse geocoding of **coordinate**. Reverse geocoding is the process of finding an address that corresponds to a given coordinate.

        A **QGeoCodeReply**  object will be returned, which can be used to manage the reverse geocoding operation and to return the results of the operation.

        The coordinate data returned in the results may be different from **coordinate**. This will usually occur if the reverse geocoding service backend shifts the coordinates to be closer to the matching addresses, or if the backend returns results at multiple levels of detail.

        If multiple results are returned by the reverse geocoding service backend they will be provided in order of specificity. This normally occurs if the backend is configured to reverse geocode across multiple levels of detail. As an example, some services will return address and coordinate pairs for the street address, the city, the state and the country.

    **Detailed Description**

    The following table gives an overview of the functionality provided by the QPlaceManager

    FunctionalityDescription
    Searching for placesUsing set of parameters such as a search term and search area, relevant places can be returned to the user.
    CategoriesPlaces can be classified as belonging to different categories. The manager supports access to these categories.
    Search term suggestionsGiven a partially complete search term, a list of potential search terms can be given.
    RecommendationsGiven an existing place, a set of similar recommended places can be suggested to the user.
    Rich ContentRich content such as images, reviews etc can be retrieved in a paged fashion.
    Place or Category managementPlaces and categories may be saved and removed. It is possible for notifications to be given when this happens.
    LocalizationDifferent locales may be specified to return place data in different languages.

    **Obtaining a QPlaceManager Instance**

    Creation of a QPlaceManager is facilitated by the **QGeoServiceProvider** . See **Initializing a manager**  for an example on how to create a manager.

    **Asynchronous Interface**

    The QPlaceManager class provides an abstraction of the datastore which contains place information. The functions provided by the QPlaceManager and primarily asynchronous and follow a request-reply model. Typically a request is given to the manager, consisting of a various set of parameters and a reply object is created. The reply object has a signal to notify when the request is done, and once completed, the reply contains the results of the request, along with any errors that occurred, if any.

    An asynchronous request is generally handled as follows:

    //1) Make an appropriate request
        **QPlaceSearchRequest**  searchRequest;
        searchRequest.setSearchTerm("ice cream");
        searchRequest.setSearchArea(**QGeoCircle** (**QGeoCoordinate** (12.34, 56.78)));

        //2) Use the manager to initiate a request and retrieve a reply object
        **QPlaceSearchReply**  * searchReply = manager->search(searchRequest);

        //3) Connect the reply object to a slot which is invoked upon operation completion
        connect(searchReply, SIGNAL(finished()), this, SLOT(processSearchReply()));
            ...
            ...
        //4) Have the slot appropriately process the results of the operation
        void processSearchReply() {
            if (searchReply->error() == **QPlaceReply** ::NoError) {
                foreach (const **QPlaceSearchResult**  &result, searchReply->results()) {
                    if (result.type() == **QPlaceSearchResult** ::PlaceResult)
                        **qDebug** () << "Title:" << result.title();
                }
            }

        //5) Discard the rely object when done.
            searchReply->deleteLater();
            searchReply = 0;
        }

    See **Common Operations**  for a list of examples demonstrating how the QPlaceManger is used.

    **Category Initialization**

    Sometime during startup of an application, the **initializeCategories** () function should be called to setup the categories. Initializing the categories enables the usage of the following functions:

    * **QPlaceManager::childCategories** ()
      * **QPlaceManager::category** ()
      * **QPlaceManager::parentCategoryId** ()
      * **QPlaceManager::childCategoryIds** ();

    If the categories need to be refreshed or reloaded, the **initializeCategories** () function may be called again.

        **QList<QLocale> QPlaceManager::locales() const**

        Returns a list of preferred locales. The locales are used as a hint to the manager for what language place and category details should be returned in.

        If the first specified locale cannot be accommodated, the manager falls back to the next and so forth. Some manager backends may not support a set of locales which are rigidly defined. An arbitrary example is that some places in France could have French and English localizations, while certain areas in America may only have the English localization available. In this example, the set of supported locales is context dependent on the search location.

        If the manager cannot accommodate any of the preferred locales, the manager falls back to using a supported language that is backend specific.

        Support for locales may vary from provider to provider. For those that do support it, by default, the global default locale is set as the manager's only locale.

        For managers that do not support locales, the locale list is always empty.

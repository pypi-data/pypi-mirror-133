    **Detailed Description**

    QAbstractXmlReceiver is an abstract base class that provides a callback interface for receiving an **XQuery sequence** , usually the output of an **QXmlQuery** , and transforming that sequence into a structure of your choosing, usually XML. Consider the example:

    **QXmlQuery**  query;
        query.setQuery("doc(\'index.html\')/html/body/p[1]");

        **QXmlSerializer**  serializer(query, myOutputDevice);
        query.evaluateTo(&serializer);

    First it constructs a **query**  that gets the first paragraph from document `index.html`. Then it constructs an **XML serializer**  with the **query**  and **myOutputDevice**  (Note the **serializer**  is an **XML receiver** , ie a subclass of QAbstractXmlReceiver). Finally, it **evaluates**  the **query** , producing an ordered sequence of calls to the **serializer\'s**  callback functions. The sequence of callbacks transforms the query output to XML and writes it to **myOutputDevice** .

    Although the example uses **QXmlQuery**  to produce the sequence of callbacks to functions in QAbstractXmlReceiver, you can call the callback functions directly as long as your sequence of calls represents a valid **XQuery sequence** .

    **XQuery Sequences**

    An **XQuery**  **sequence** is an ordered collection of zero, one, or many **items**. Each **item** is either an **atomic value** or a **node**. An **atomic value** is a simple data value.

    There are six kinds of **nodes**.

    * An **Element Node** represents an XML element.
      * An **Attribute Node** represents an XML attribute.
      * A **Document Node** represents an entire XML document.
      * A **Text Node** represents character data (element content).
      * A **Processing Instruction Node** represents an XML processing instruction, which is used in an XML document to tell the application reading the document to perform some action. A typical example is to use a processing instruction to tell the application to use a particular XSLT stylesheet to display the document.
      * And a **Comment node** represents an XML comment.

    The **sequence** of **nodes** and **atomic values** obeys the following rules. Note that **Namespace Node** refers to a special **Attribute Node** with name **xmlns**.

    * Each **node** appears in the **sequence** before its children and their descendants appear.
      * A **node** \'s descendants appear in the **sequence** before any of its siblings appear.
      * A **Document Node** represents an entire document. Zero or more **Document Nodes** can appear in a **sequence** , but they can only be top level items (i.e., a **Document Node** can\'t be a child of another **node**.
      * **Namespace Nodes** immediately follow the **Element Node** with which they are associated.
      * **Attribute Nodes** immediately follow the **Namespace Nodes** of the element with which they are associated, or...
      * If there are no **Namespace Nodes** following an element, then the **Attribute Nodes** immediately follow the element.
      * An **atomic value** can only appear as a top level **item** , i.e., it can\'t appear as a child of a **node**.
      * **Processing Instruction Nodes** do not have children, and their parent is either a **Document Node** or an **Element Node**.
      * **Comment Nodes** do not have children, and their parent is either a **Document Node** or an **Element Node**.

    The **sequence** of **nodes** and **atomic values** is sent to an QAbstractXmlReceiver (**QXmlSerializer**  in the example above) as a sequence of calls to the receiver\'s callback functions. The mapping of callback functions to sequence items is as follows.

    * **startDocument** () and **endDocument** () are called for each **Document Node** in the **sequence**. **endDocument** () is not called until all the **Document Node\'s** children have appeared in the **sequence**.
      * **startElement** () and **endElement** () are called for each **Element Node**. **endElement** () is not called until all the **Element Node\'s** children have appeared in the **sequence**.
      * **attribute** () is called for each **Attribute Node**.
      * **comment** () is called for each **Comment Node**.
      * **characters** () is called for each **Text Node**.
      * **processingInstruction** () is called for each **Processing Instruction Node**.
      * **namespaceBinding** () is called for each **Namespace Node**.
      * **atomicValue** () is called for each **atomic value**.

        This callback is called when a namespace binding is in scope of an element. A namespace is defined by a URI. In the **QXmlName**  **name** , the value of **QXmlName::namespaceUri** () is that URI. The value of **QXmlName::prefix** () is the prefix that the URI is bound to. The local name is insignificant and can be an arbitrary value.

        This callback is called when a processing instruction appears in the **sequence** . A processing instruction is used in an XML document to tell the application reading the document to perform some action. A typical example is to use a processing instruction to tell the application to use a particular XSLT stylesheet to process the document.

        <?xml-stylesheet type="test/xsl" href="formatter.xsl"?>

        **target** is the **name**  of the processing instruction. Its **prefix** and **namespace URI** must both be empty. Its **local name** is the target. In the above example, the name is **xml-stylesheet**.

        The **value** specifies the action to be taken. Note that the **value** must not contain the string "?>". In the above example, the **value** is **type="test/xsl" href="formatter.xsl**.

        Generally, use of processing instructions should be avoided, because they are not namespace aware and in many contexts are stripped out anyway. Processing instructions can often be replaced with elements from a custom namespace.

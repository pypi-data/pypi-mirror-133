    **Detailed Description**

    Key events are sent to the widget with keyboard input focus when keys are pressed or released.

    A key event contains a special accept flag that indicates whether the receiver will handle the key event. This flag is set by default for **QEvent::KeyPress**  and **QEvent::KeyRelease** , so there is no need to call **accept** () when acting on a key event. For **QEvent::ShortcutOverride**  the receiver needs to explicitly accept the event to trigger the override. Calling **ignore** () on a key event will propagate it to the parent widget. The event is propagated up the parent widget chain until a widget accepts it or an event filter consumes it.

    The **QWidget::setEnabled** () function can be used to enable or disable mouse and keyboard events for a widget.

    The event handlers **QWidget::keyPressEvent** (), **QWidget::keyReleaseEvent** (), **QGraphicsItem::keyPressEvent** () and **QGraphicsItem::keyReleaseEvent** () receive key events.

    **See also** **QFocusEvent**  and **QWidget::grabKeyboard** ().

        Int **key** is the code for the **Qt::Key**  that the event loop should listen for.

The **modifiers** holds the keyboard modifiers, and the given **text** is the Unicode text that the key generated. If **autorep** is true, **isAutoRepeat** () will be true. **count** is the number of keys involved in the event.

        Returns `true` if this event comes from an auto-repeating key; returns `false` if it comes from an initial key press.

        Note that if the event is a multiple-key compressed event that is partly due to auto-repeat, this function could return either true or false indeterminately.

        **int QKeyEvent::key() const**

        Returns the code of the key that was pressed or released.

        See **Qt::Key**  for the list of keyboard codes. These codes are independent of the underlying window system. Note that this function does not distinguish between capital and non-capital letters, use the **text** () function (returning the Unicode text the key generated) for this purpose.

        A value of either 0 or **Qt::Key_unknown**  means that the event is not the result of a known key; for example, it may be the result of a compose sequence, a keyboard macro, or due to key event compression.

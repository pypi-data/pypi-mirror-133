    **Detailed Description**

    Each network interface can contain zero or more IP addresses, which in turn can be associated with a netmask and/or a broadcast address (depending on support from the operating system).

    This class represents one such group.

        **QHostAddress QNetworkAddressEntry::broadcast() const**

        Returns the broadcast address associated with the IPv4 address and netmask. It can usually be derived from those two by setting to 1 the bits of the IP address where the netmask contains a 0. (In other words, by bitwise-OR\'ing the IP address with the inverse of the netmask)

        This member is always empty for IPv6 addresses, since the concept of broadcast has been abandoned in that system in favor of multicast. In particular, the group of hosts corresponding to all the nodes in the local network can be reached by the "all-nodes" special multicast group (address FF02::1).

        **QNetworkAddressEntry::DnsEligibilityStatus QNetworkAddressEntry::dnsEligibility() const**

        Returns whether this address is eligible for publication in the Domain Name System (DNS) or similar name resolution mechanisms.

        In general, an address is suitable for publication if it is an address this machine will be reached at for an indeterminate amount of time, though it need not be permanent. For example, addresses obtained via DHCP are often eligible, but cryptographically-generated temporary IPv6 addresses are not.

        On some systems, **QNetworkInterface**  will need to heuristically determine which addresses are eligible.

        This function was introduced in Qt 5.11.

        **bool QNetworkAddressEntry::isPermanent() const**

        Returns `true` if this address is permanent on this interface, `false` if it's temporary. A permenant address is one which has no expiration time and is often static (manually configured).

        If this information could not be determined, this function returns `true`.

        **Note:** Depending on the operating system and the networking configuration tool, it is possible for a temporary address to be interpreted as permanent, if the tool did not inform the details correctly to the operating system.

        Returns the netmask associated with the IP address. The netmask is expressed in the form of an IP address, such as 255.255.0.0.

        For IPv6 addresses, the prefix length is converted to an address where the number of bits set to 1 is equal to the prefix length. For a prefix length of 64 bits (the most common value), the netmask will be expressed as a **QHostAddress**  holding the address FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF::

        Returns the deadline when this address becomes deprecated (no longer preferred), if known. If the address lifetime is not known (see **isLifetimeKnown** ()), this function always returns **QDeadlineTimer::Forever** .

        While an address is preferred, it may be used by the operating system as the source address for new, outgoing packets. After it becomes deprecated, it will remain valid for incoming packets for a while longer until finally removed (see **validityLifetime** ()).

For IPv6 addresses, it's contained between 0 and 128 and is the preferred form of representing addresses.

        This function returns -1 if the prefix length could not be determined (i.e., **netmask** () returns a null QHostAddress()).

    **Detailed Description**

    The QNetworkReply class contains the data and meta data related to a request posted with **QNetworkAccessManager** . Like **QNetworkRequest** , it contains a URL and headers (both in parsed and raw form), some information about the reply's state and the contents of the reply itself.

    QNetworkReply is a sequential-access **QIODevice** , which means that once data is read from the object, it no longer kept by the device. It is therefore the application's responsibility to keep this data if it needs to. Whenever more data is received from the network and processed, the **readyRead** () signal is emitted.

    The **downloadProgress** () signal is also emitted when data is received, but the number of bytes contained in it may not represent the actual bytes received, if any transformation is done to the contents (for example, decompressing and removing the protocol overhead).

    Even though QNetworkReply is a **QIODevice**  connected to the contents of the reply, it also emits the **uploadProgress** () signal, which indicates the progress of the upload for operations that have such content.

    **Note:** Do not delete the object in the slot connected to the **errorOccurred** () or **finished** () signal. Use **deleteLater** ().

    **See also** **QNetworkRequest**  and **QNetworkAccessManager** .

        This signal is emitted to indicate the progress of the download part of this network request, if there's any. If there's no download associated with this request, this signal will be emitted once with 0 as the value of both **bytesReceived** and **bytesTotal**.

        The **bytesReceived** parameter indicates the number of bytes received, while **bytesTotal** indicates the total number of bytes expected to be downloaded. If the number of bytes to be downloaded is not known, **bytesTotal** will be -1.

        The download is finished when **bytesReceived** is equal to **bytesTotal**. At that time, **bytesTotal** will not be -1.

        **[signal] void QNetworkReply::encrypted()**

        This signal is emitted when an SSL/TLS session has successfully completed the initial handshake. At this point, no user data has been transmitted. The signal can be used to perform additional checks on the certificate chain, for example to notify users when the certificate for a website has changed. If the reply does not match the expected criteria then it should be aborted by calling **QNetworkReply::abort** () by a slot connected to this signal. The SSL configuration in use can be inspected using the **QNetworkReply::sslConfiguration** () method.

        Internally, **QNetworkAccessManager**  may open multiple connections to a server, in order to allow it process requests in parallel. These connections may be reused, which means that the encrypted() signal would not be emitted. This means that you are only guaranteed to receive this signal for the first connection to a site in the lifespan of the **QNetworkAccessManager** .

        This function was introduced in Qt 5.1.

        This signal is emitted when the reply detects an error in processing. The **finished** () signal will probably follow, indicating that the connection is over.

        The **code** parameter contains the code of the error that was detected. Call **errorString** () to obtain a textual representation of the error condition.

        **Note:** Do not delete the object in the slot connected to this signal. Use **deleteLater** ().

        **[signal] void QNetworkReply::finished()**

        This signal is emitted when the reply has finished processing. After this signal is emitted, there will be no more updates to the reply's data or metadata.

        Unless **close** () or **abort** () have been called, the reply will be still be opened for reading, so the data can be retrieved by calls to **read** () or **readAll** (). In particular, if no calls to **read** () were made as a result of **readyRead** (), a call to **readAll** () will retrieve the full contents in a **QByteArray** .

        This signal is emitted in tandem with **QNetworkAccessManager::finished** () where that signal's reply parameter is this object.

        **Note:** Do not delete the object in the slot connected to this signal. Use **deleteLater** ().

        You can also use **isFinished** () to check if a **QNetworkReply**  has finished even before you receive the finished() signal.

        This signal is emitted whenever the metadata in this reply changes. metadata is any information that is not the content (data) itself, including the network headers. In the majority of cases, the metadata will be known fully by the time the first byte of data is received. However, it is possible to receive updates of headers or other metadata during the processing of the data.

        **[signal] void QNetworkReply::preSharedKeyAuthenticationRequired(QSslPreSharedKeyAuthenticator * authenticator )**

        This signal is emitted if the SSL/TLS handshake negotiates a PSK ciphersuite, and therefore a PSK authentication is then required.

        When using PSK, the client must send to the server a valid identity and a valid pre shared key, in order for the SSL handshake to continue. Applications can provide this information in a slot connected to this signal, by filling in the passed **authenticator** object according to their needs.

        **Note:** Ignoring this signal, or failing to provide the required credentials, will cause the handshake to fail, and therefore the connection to be aborted.

        **Note:** The **authenticator** object is owned by the reply and must not be deleted by the application.

        To indicate that the errors are not fatal and that the connection should proceed, the **ignoreSslErrors** () function should be called from the slot connected to this signal. If it is not called, the SSL session will be torn down before any data is exchanged (including the URL).

        This signal can be used to display an error message to the user indicating that security may be compromised and display the SSL settings (see **sslConfiguration** () to obtain it). If the user decides to proceed after analyzing the remote certificate, the slot should call **ignoreSslErrors** ().

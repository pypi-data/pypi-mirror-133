    **Detailed Description**

    QWebEngineDownloadItem models a download throughout its life cycle, starting with a pending download request and finishing with a completed download. It can be used, for example, to get information about new downloads, to monitor progress, and to pause, resume, and cancel downloads.

    Downloads are usually triggered by user interaction on a web page. It is the **QWebEngineProfile** 's responsibility to notify the application of new download requests, which it does by emitting the **downloadRequested**  signal together with a newly created QWebEngineDownloadItem. The application can then examine this item and decide whether to accept it or not. A signal handler must explicitly call **accept** () on the item for Qt WebEngine to actually start downloading and writing data to disk. If no signal handler calls **accept** (), then the download request will be automatically rejected and nothing will be written to disk.

    **Note:** Some properties, such as setting the path and file name where the file will be saved (see **downloadDirectory** () and **downloadFileName** ()), can only be changed before calling **accept** ().

    **Object Life Cycle**

    All items are guaranteed to be valid during the emission of the **downloadRequested**  signal. If **accept** () is **not** called by any signal handler, then the item will be deleted **immediately** after signal emission. This means that the application **must not** keep references to rejected download items. It also means the application should not use a queued connection to this signal.

    If **accept** () **is** called by a signal handler, then the **QWebEngineProfile**  will take ownership of the item. However, it is safe for the application to delete the item at any time, except during the handling of the **downloadRequested**  signal. The **QWebEngineProfile**  being a long-lived object, it is in fact recommended that the application delete any items it is no longer interested in.

    **Note:** Deleting an item will also automatically cancel a download since 5.12.2, but it is recommended to cancel manually before deleting for portability.

    **Web Page Downloads**

    In addition to normal file downloads, which consist simply of retrieving some raw bytes from the network and writing them to disk, Qt WebEngine also supports saving complete web pages, which involves parsing the page's HTML, downloading any dependent resources, and potentially packaging everything into a special file format (**savePageFormat** ). To check if a download is for a file or a web page, use **isSavePageDownload** .

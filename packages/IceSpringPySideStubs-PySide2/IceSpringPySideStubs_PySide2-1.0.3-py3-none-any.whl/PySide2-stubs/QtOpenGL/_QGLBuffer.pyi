    https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qglbuffer.html

    **Detailed Description**

    Buffer objects are created in the GL server so that the client application can avoid uploading vertices, indices, texture image data, etc every time they are needed.

    QGLBuffer objects can be copied around as a reference to the underlying GL buffer object:

    **QGLBuffer**  buffer1(**QGLBuffer** ::IndexBuffer);
            buffer1.create();

            **QGLBuffer**  buffer2 = buffer1;

    QGLBuffer performs a shallow copy when objects are copied in this manner, but does not implement copy-on-write semantics. The original object will be affected whenever the copy is modified.

    **Note:** This class has been deprecated in favor of **QOpenGLBuffer** .

        Binds the buffer associated with this object to the current GL context. Returns `false` if binding was not possible, usually because **type** () is not supported on this GL implementation.

        The buffer must be bound to the same QGLContext current when **create** () was called, or to another QGLContext that is sharing with it. Otherwise, false will be returned from this function.

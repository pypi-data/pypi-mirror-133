.SS "Main Idea: the NOUN VERB syntax"
Vinca uses a NOUN VERB syntax\. The two kinds of nouns are a \fIcollection\fR of cards and a specific \fIcard\fR\.
.SS "Examples of NOUN VERB syntax\."
.TP
\fBvinca col browse\fR
\fIcol\fR is the noun; it refers to the entire collection of cards\. \fIbrowse\fR is the verb; it launches the browser for this collection of cards\.
.TP
\fBvinca col review\fR
\fIcol\fR is the noun; \fIreview\fR is the verb\.
.TP
\fBvinca lc edit\fR
\fIlc\fR is the noun; it refers to the most recently created card ("last\-card") \fIedit\fR is the verb; this command will edit the most recently created card
.TP
\fBvinca lc delete\fR
\fIlc\fR is the noun; it refers to the most recently created card ("last\-card") \fIdelete\fR is the verb; this command will delete the card we just created
.SS "Chaining"
If the output of a command is a noun we can apply a verb to it\.
.SS "Examples of Chaining"
.TP
\fBvinca col sort due\-date browse\fR
\fBcol sort due\-date\fR returns a list of cards sorted by due\-date\. We then open a browser with these cards to browse these cards sorted by due\-date\.
.TP
\fBvinca col findall Lincoln delete\fR
\fBcol findall Lincoln\fR returns a list of cards containing the word Lincoln\. This command will delete all of them\.
.SS "Indexing"
We can refer to a card by its position in a collection\. \fINOTE\fR: indicies begin at 0 not 1\.
.SS "Examples of Indexing"
Suppose \fBvinca findall Lincoln\fR returns the following list of cards:
.IP "" 4
.nf
\- Who is the 16th American president? | Lincoln
\- What was Lincoln\'s first name? | Abraham
.fi
.IP "" 0
.P
Then we can reference these cards by their index:
.IP "" 4
.nf
* `vinca findall Lincoln \- 1 delete`:
    This will erase the card asking for Lincoln\'s first name\.

* `vinca findall Lincoln \- 0 review`:
    This will review the first card\.
.fi
.IP "" 0
.SS "Exceptions to the NOUN VERB syntax"
The most import abbreviation is the ommission of \fIcol\fR\.
.IP "" 4
.nf
\- `vinca purge` is equivalent `vinca col purge`
\- `vinca count` is equivalent to `vinca col count`
.fi
.IP "" 0
.P
The set\-cards\-path command is used to specify a directory which vinca will search for cards\.

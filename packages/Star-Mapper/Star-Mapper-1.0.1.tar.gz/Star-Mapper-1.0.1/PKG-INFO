Description: Star-Mapper
        
        Calls every link on a given website and produces an explorable graph visualization.
        
        Please note that the graph layout can take a long time since it is JS based. Loading a graph with 3000 Nodes may take 5 minutes or more.
        
        
        Only map websites you own, as this tool will open any link on a given  
        website, which can potentially incure high costs for the owner and be interpreted   
        as a small scale DOS attack.  
        
        optional arguments:  
        -h, --help            show this help message and exit  
        -url                  url to map  
        --plot-cached         path to cached file  
        -limit                maximum number of nodes on original site

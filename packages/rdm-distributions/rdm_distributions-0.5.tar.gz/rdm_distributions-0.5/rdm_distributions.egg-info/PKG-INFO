Description: # Normal and Binomial Distributions (Basics)
        <img src='images/logo.png'>
        
        This project is just a package which calculates some basic statistics, handle simple operations and show some plots about the Normal and the Binomial statistical Distributions.

        # Intallation
        ## Dependencies
        This project requires the following:
        - Python (>= 3.8)
        
        With the following packages:
        - Matplotlib (>= 3.3)
        - Scipy (>= 1.6)
        
        ---
        
        # Project description
        This is a very basic package, which could grow in the future but there isn't a plan by now for future improvements.
        
        Now this package contains the following statistical distributions:
        > - Gaussian
        > - Binomial
        
        and handles the following operations:
        > - Calculate the mean
        > - Calculate the standard deviation
        > - Sum two distributions (only with the same p for Binomial)
        > - Plot PDF (probability density function)

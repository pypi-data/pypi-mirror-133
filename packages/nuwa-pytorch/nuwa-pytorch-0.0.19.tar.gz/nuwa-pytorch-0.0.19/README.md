## NÜWA - Pytorch (wip)

<a href="https://discord.gg/xBPBXfcFHd"><img alt="Join us on Discord" src="https://img.shields.io/discord/823813159592001537?color=5865F2&logo=discord&logoColor=white"></a></br>

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12417">NÜWA</a>, state of the art attention network for text to video synthesis, in Pytorch. It may also contain an extension into video and audio, using a dual decoder approach.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install nuwa-pytorch
```

## Usage

First train the VAE

```python
import torch
from nuwa_pytorch import VQGanVAE

vae = VQGanVAE(
    dim = 512,
    image_size = 256,
    num_layers = 4
)

imgs = torch.randn(10, 3, 256, 256)

# alternate learning for autoencoder ...

loss = vae(imgs, return_loss = True)
loss.backward()

# and the discriminator ...

discr_loss = vae(imgs, return_discr_loss = True)
discr_loss.backward()

# do above for many steps
```

Then, with your learned VAE

```python
import torch
from nuwa_pytorch import NUWA, VQGanVAE

# autoencoder

vae = VQGanVAE(
    dim = 512,
    num_layers = 4,
    image_size = 256
)

# NUWA transformer

nuwa = NUWA(
    vae = vae,
    dim = 512,
    max_video_frames = 5,
    text_num_tokens = 20000,
    image_size = 256
).cuda()

# data

text = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 256)).cuda()
mask = torch.ones(1, 256).bool().cuda()
video = torch.randn(1, 5, 3, 256, 256).cuda()

loss = nuwa(
    text = text,
    video = video,
    return_loss = True
)

loss.backward()

# do above with as much data as possible

# then you can generate a video from text

video = nuwa.generate(text = text) # (1, 5, 3, 256, 256)

```

## Todo

- [x] complete 3dna causal attention in decoder
- [x] write up easy generation functions
- [x] make sure GAN portion of VQGan is correct, reread paper
- [x] make sure adaptive weight in vqgan is correctly built
- [x] offer new vqvae improvements (orthogonal reg and smaller codebook dimensions)
- [x] batch video tokens -> vae during video generation, to prevent oom
- [x] query chunking in 3dna attention, to put a cap on peak memory
- [x] flesh out VAE resnet blocks, offer some choices
- [x] add all stability tricks from cogview paper by default
- [ ] add cosine sim attention from swinv2 as an option
- [ ] offer vqvae training script
- [ ] take care of audio transformer and cross modality attention
- [ ] segmentation mask encoder, make sure embeddings can undergo 3dna attention with decoder during cross attention
- [ ] add audio transformer, and build audio / video nearby cross attention
- [ ] add some autotrainer that takes care of the alternating updates of discriminator and VQVAE generator
- [ ] make VQGan able to accept custom VGG for LPAPs loss (audio)
- [ ] add reversible networks and feedforward chunking, a la Reformer, to save on memory
- [ ] allow for variable lengthed videos in sparse 3dna non-causal attention

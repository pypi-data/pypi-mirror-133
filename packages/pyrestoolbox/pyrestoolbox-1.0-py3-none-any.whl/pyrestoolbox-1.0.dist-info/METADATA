\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--A collection of
Reservoir Engineering Utilities

This set of functions focuses on those that the author uses often while
crafting programming solutions. These are the scripts that are often
copy/pasted from previous work - sometimes slightly modified - resulting
in a trail of slightly different versions over the years. Some attempt
has been made here to make this implementation flexible enough such that
it can be relied on as-is going forward.

Includes functions to perform simple calculations including;

-   Inflow for oil and gas
-   PVT Calculations for oil
-   PVT calculation for gas
-   Creation of Black Oil Table information
-   Creation of layered permeability distribution consistent with a
    Lorenze heterogeneity factor
-   Extract problem cells information from Intesect (IX) print files
-   Generation of AQUTAB include file influence functions for use in
    ECLIPSE
-   Creation of Corey and LET relative permeability tables in Eclipse
    format

Apologies in advance that it is only in oilfield
units with no current plans to add multi-unit support.

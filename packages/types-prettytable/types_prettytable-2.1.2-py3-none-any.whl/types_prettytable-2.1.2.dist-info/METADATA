## Typing stubs for prettytable

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `prettytable` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `prettytable`. The source for this package can be found at

types and metadata should be contributed there.

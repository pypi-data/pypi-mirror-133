"""This module defines classes for a Bayesian probabilistic model of EMA data.
The model is learned using observed EMA recordings from all subjects,
stored in an ema_data.EmaDataSet instance.

This model version uses a mixture of Gaussian distributions
for the parameter vectors in each sub-population of respondents,
represented by one group of subjects,
with different mixture weights for each sub-population.

Individual parameter distributions are approximated by sampling.
The sub-population mixture model is prior for all individuals in the group.

The model can NOT use Bayesian sequential learning.
It must be trained in a single run from a single batch of EMA data,
which is usually quite sufficient for practical applications.
However, the learn(...) method can be called several times, if needed.

*** Class Overview:

EmaModel: Defines posterior distributions of scenario probabilities,
    and locations of latent variables for perceptual attribute(s),
    learned from EMA data in an ema_data.EmaDataSet instance.
    Includes a GroupModel instance for each sub-population / participant group.

GroupModel: Defines GMM mixture weights for ONE (sub-)population,
    and contains all individual response-probability models,
    as implemented by an IndividualModel instance for each subject,
    in ONE group of test subjects, assumed recruited from ONE sub-population.

IndividualModel: Distribution of individual parameter vector
    assumed to determine the observed EMA data for ONE subject,
    including, in each EMA record,
    (1) a nominal (possibly multi-dimensional) Scenario, and
    (2) ordinal Ratings for zero, one, or more subjective Attributes.


*** Model Theory: The present model is theoretically similar to
the model of the PairedCompCalc package, partly described in
A. Leijon, M. Dahlquist, and K. Smeds (2019):
Bayesian analysis of paired-comparison sound quality ratings. JASA 146(5):3174–3183.

EXCEPT for the present use of a mixture model for the total population.

Detailed math documentation is presented in

*** Version History:
* Version 0.7:
2021-12-15, new method IndividualModel.mean_attribute_grade
2021-12-20, new method IndividualModel.nap_diff, calculate NAP distance

* Version 0.6:
2021-12-06, Allow user control switches: restrict_attribute OR restrict_threshold
2021-12-08, restrict_attribute: sensory-variable location average forced -> 0.
            restrict_threshold: response-threshold median forced -> 0.

* Version 0.5:
2021-11-03, first functional version
2021-11-04, removed GroupModel.initialize_weights and IndividualModel.initialize_weights
2021-11-05, Hamiltonian sampler -> IndividualModel property -> better stepsize optimization
2021-11-07, store PopulationMixtureBase object as property, so it gets pickled automatically

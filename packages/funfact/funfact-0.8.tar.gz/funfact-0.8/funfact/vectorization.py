def vectorize(tsrex, n, append: bool = True):
    ''''Vectorize' a tensor expression by extending its dimensionality by one.
    Each slice along the vectorization dimension of a factorization model
    represents an independent realization of the original tensor expression.
    A typical use case is multi-replica optimization.

    The dimensionality of each leaf (tensor) node of the expression will be
    increments using the following rule:

    - If the tensor has a random initializer, then its shape is simply
    extended, i.e. `shape_vectorized = (*shape_vectorized, n)`.
    - If the tensor has a concrete initializer, then a broadcasting dimension
    will be appended to the initializer, i.e.
    `initializer_vectorized = initializer_vectorized[..., None]`.

    Args:
        n (int > 0):
            Size of the vectorization dimension.
        append (bool):
            If True, the vectorizing index is set to the last index of every
            leaf. If False, the vectorizing index is set to the first index
            of every leaf.

    Returns
        TsrEx:
            A vectorized tensor expression.

``vak`` is a library that makes it easier
for researchers studying animal
vocalizations---such as birdsong, bat calls,
and even human speech---to work with
neural network algorithms.

Currently the main use is automated **annotation** of animal vocalizations.
By **annotation**, we mean something like this example of annotated birdsong:

Please see links below for information on how to get started and how to use ``vak`` to
apply neural network models to your data.

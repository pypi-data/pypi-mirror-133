|version|, |today|, status: draft

The **pacbio_qc** pipeline is a `Sequana <https://github.com/sequana/sequana>`__ pipeline. You can find the source code 
on  `https://github.com/sequana/sequana_pacbio_qc <https://github.com/sequana/sequana_pacbio_qc/>`_. Would you have issues
about the code, usage or lack of information, please fill a report 
on `Sequana itself <https://github.com/sequana/sequana/issues>`_ indicating the pipeline name (We centralized all 
pipelines issues on **Sequana** repository only so as to be more responsive).

What is Sequana ?
=====================

**Sequana** is a versatile tool that provides

#. A Python library dedicated to NGS analysis (e.g., tools to visualise standard NGS formats).
#. A set of Pipelines dedicated to NGS in the form of Snakefiles
#. Standalone applications
    #. sequana_coverage ease the
       extraction of genomic regions of interest and genome coverage information
    #. sequana_taxonomy performs a quick
       taxonomy of your FastQ. This requires dedicated databases to be downloaded.
    #. Sequanix, a GUI for Snakemake workflows (hence Sequana pipelines as well)

Description: # The Unofficial Python wrapper for Cornershop by Uber's API
        
        Cornershop is a grocery delivery service owned by Uber.
        
        This API allows the user to search for all available stores near a given zip code.
        
        Please, check their official website at: https://cornershopapp.com/
        
        ## Instalation
        
        - `pip install cornershop`
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        - Python 3.6 or higher
        - requests
        
        ## License
        
        - [MIT](LICENSE)
        
        Even though this is just a wrapper, use it with caution, since the data fetched is Uber's property.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        First, import and instanciate the Cornershop API model using your zip code as locality.
        
        ```python
        >>> from cornershop import Cornershop
        
        >>> cs = Cornershop(
        ...     locality = '00000000',
        ...     country = 'BR'
        ... )
        ```
        
        Then, call the following methods to fetch data from branches near your locality.
        
        ```python
        >>> cs.search_branches(query='...')
        >>> cs.search_branch(branch_id='00000', query='...')
        >>> cs.search_branch_group()
        >>> cs.search_countries()
        ```
        
        Set the `json_format` argument as `True` to return a json-style dictionaty instead of a `cornershop` model.
        
        ```python
        >>> cs = Cornershop(
        ...     locality = '00000000',
        ...     country = 'BR',
        ...     json_format = True
        ... )
        ```

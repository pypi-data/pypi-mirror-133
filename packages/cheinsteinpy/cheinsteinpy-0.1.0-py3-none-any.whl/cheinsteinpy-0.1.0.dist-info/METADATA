# cheinstein.py

## A Python library to get information from Chegg.

> **Note**: I am not affiliated with chegg.com in any way.

Chegg is a great resource for many students around the world. Though since it is a paid resource, it is not accessible to everyone. With cheinstein.py, it parses the information from chegg.com, and makes it much easier to work with.

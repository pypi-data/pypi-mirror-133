# List of what have been done in new versions

## 0.1.x - 11/2021

- [x] Config changed, so property is called with no function parameters. With parenthesis it would fails. Reason is that annotations are now used for type and option checking, so less code and also for better IDE help and better intelisense. It is not possible to use custom getters and setters anymore.

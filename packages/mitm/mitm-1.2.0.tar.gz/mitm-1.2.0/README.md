A customizable man-in-the-middle TCP proxy with support for HTTP & HTTPS.

## Installing

```
pip install mitm
```

Note that OpenSSL 1.1.1 or greater is required.

## Documentation

Documentation can be found [**here**](https://synchronizing.github.io/mitm/). 

## Using

You can easily boot-up the proxy and start intercepting traffic:

```python
from mitm import MITM, protocol, middleware, crypto

mitm = MITM(
    host="127.0.0.1",
    port=8888,
    protocols=[protocol.HTTP],
    middlewares=[middleware.Log],
    buffer_size=8192,
    timeout=5,
    ssl_context=crypto.mitm_ssl_default_context(),
)
mitm.run()
```

Above is the default values for the `MITM` class. 

While the example above is sufficient for printing out incoming/outgoing messages, the bread and butter of `mitm` is the ability to add custom protocols and middlewares.

#### Protocols

`mitm` allows the addition of custom application-layer protocols that can be used to intercept and redirect traffic. Built-into the `mitm` library is the HTTP protocol (with TLS/`CONNECT` support). To read and understand more about protocols check out the documentations.

#### Middlewares

Custom middlewares allow programmatic customizations to incoming and outgoing requests. Middlewares can be used to modify the request, response, or both. To read and understand more about middlewares check out the documentation.

### Example

Using the example above we can send a request to the server via another script:

```python
import requests

proxies = {"http": "http://127.0.0.1:8888", "https": "http://127.0.0.1:8888"}
requests.get("https://httpbin.org/anything", proxies=proxies, verify=False)
```

Which will lead to the following being logged where `mitm` is running in:

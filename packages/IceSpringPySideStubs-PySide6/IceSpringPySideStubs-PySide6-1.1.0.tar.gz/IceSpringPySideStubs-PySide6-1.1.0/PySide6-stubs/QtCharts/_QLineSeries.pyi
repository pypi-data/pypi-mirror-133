    **Detailed Description**

    A line chart is used to show information as a series of data points
    connected by straight lines.

    ![](images/examples_linechart.png)

    Creating a basic line chart is simple:

    **QLineSeries** * series = new **QLineSeries** ();
        series->append(0, 6);
    series->append(2, 4);
        ...
        chart->addSeries(series);

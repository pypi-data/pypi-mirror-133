Description: # gdb-call-lambda
        Call C++ lambda functions from gdb.
        
        ## Install
        
        * Install the Python package in somewhere Python can see.
        * In .gdbinit add:
        
        ```
        python import gdb_call_lambda
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Call a lambda like `printl f(x)`, where the `f` is the lambda.
        
        I.e., call as usual, just replace `print` with `printl`.
        
        The lambda expression (`f` in this case) must not have any `(` characters.
        
        Alternatively, use the convenience function: `print $calll(f, x)`
        
        ## How it works internally/what to do if it doesn't work
        
        See post https://stackoverflow.com/a/70254108/5267751.
        
        There's a known bug where gdb/tools can't demangle a symbol that gcc generates, see `B` in test.

Overview
========

filebrowser_safe is a permanent fork of
`FileBrowser asset manager <https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-filebrowser>`_
for `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_, to be referenced as a
dependency for the `Mezzanine CMS for Django <http://mezzanine.jupo.org/>`_.

At the time of filebrowser_safe's creation, FileBrowser was incorrectly
packaged on `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_, and had also dropped
compatibility with Django 1.1 -- filebrowser_safe was therefore created to
address these specific issues.

For further details, see
`Why are Grappelli and Filebrowser Forked? <http://mezzanine.jupo.org/docs/frequently-asked-questions.html#grappelli-filebrowser-forks>`_.

Then the composite cathode was fabricated by coating the slurry of a mixture containing submicron LLZNO powder and Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) with a weight ratio of 9:1 onto the positive electrode layer. The composite cathode was punched into disks with 18 mm diameters after compacted by a roller press (Shenzhen Kejingstar Technology Ltd., Shenzhen, China), and the density of composite cathode was about 2.5 g/cm

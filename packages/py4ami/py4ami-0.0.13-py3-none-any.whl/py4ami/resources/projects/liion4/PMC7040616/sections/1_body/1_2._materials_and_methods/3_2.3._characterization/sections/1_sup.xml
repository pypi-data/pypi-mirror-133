The microtopography of the submicron LLZNO powder and cross section of the ceramic pellets was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM, TESCAN MIRA3 LMU, TESCAN Orsay Holding, a. s., Brno, Czech Republic). Energy dispersive spectrometer (Oxford X-ray Max20, Oxford Instruments plc, Oxford, UK) mapping was used to characterize the distribution of each element in the cross section of the ceramic pellets. The total lithium ion conductivity of the ceramic pellets was measured by an Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS, Gamry Reference 600+, Gamry Instruments, Warminster, PA, USA) within a temperature range of 25&#8211;80 &#176;C, within the frequency of 10 Hz&#8211;5 MHz, and with an AC amplitude of 40 mV. The blocking electrode was uniformly coated by a thin silver layer on both sides of the ceramic pellets. The activation energy of the ceramic pellets was measured within a temperature range of 25&#8211;80 &#176;C and calculated based on the Arrhenius equation [

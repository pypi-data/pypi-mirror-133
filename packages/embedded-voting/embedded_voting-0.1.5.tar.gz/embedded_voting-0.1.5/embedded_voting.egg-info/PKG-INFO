This contains the code for the work on embedded voting done during my internship at Nokia


* Free software: GNU General Public License v3
* Documentation: https://embedded-voting.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

* Create a voting profile in which voters are associated to embeddings.
* Run elections on these profiles with different rules, using the geometrical aspects of the embeddings.
* The rules are defined for cardinal preferences, but some of them are adapted for the case of ordinal preferences.
* There are rules for single-winner elections and multi-winner elections.
* Classes to analyse the evolution of the score when the embeddings of one voter are changing.
* Classes to analyse the manipulability of the rules.
* Classes for algorithm aggregation.
* A lot of tutorials.

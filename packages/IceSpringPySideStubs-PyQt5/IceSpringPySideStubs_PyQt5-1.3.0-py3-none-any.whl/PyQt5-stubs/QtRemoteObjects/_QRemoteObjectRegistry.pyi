    **Detailed Description**

    The Registry is a special Source/Replica pair held by a **node**  itself. It
    knows about all other **Source** s available on the network, and simplifies
    the process of connecting to other **node** s.

        **QRemoteObjectSourceLocations QRemoteObjectRegistry::sourceLocations()

        Returns a QRemoteObjectSourceLocations object, which includes the name
        and additional information of all sources known to the registry.

        This signal is emitted whenever a new source location is added to the

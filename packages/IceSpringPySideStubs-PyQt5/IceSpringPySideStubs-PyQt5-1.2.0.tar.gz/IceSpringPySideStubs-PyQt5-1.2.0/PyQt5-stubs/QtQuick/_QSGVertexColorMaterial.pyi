    **Detailed Description**

    **Warning:** This utility class is only functional when running with the
    default backend of the Qt Quick scenegraph.

    The vertex color material will give each vertex in a geometry a color.
    Pixels between vertices will be linearly interpolated. The colors can
    contain transparency.

    The geometry to be rendered with vertex color must have the following
    layout. Attribute position 0 must contain vertices. Attribute position 1
    must contain colors, a tuple of 4 values with RGBA layout. Both floats in
    the range of 0 to 1 and unsigned bytes in the range 0 to 255 are valid for
    the color values.

    **Note:** The rendering pipeline expects pixels with premultiplied alpha.

    **QSGGeometry::defaultAttributes_ColoredPoint2D** () can be used to
    construct an attribute set that is compatible with this material.

    The vertex color material respects both current opacity and current matrix
    when updating it's rendering state.

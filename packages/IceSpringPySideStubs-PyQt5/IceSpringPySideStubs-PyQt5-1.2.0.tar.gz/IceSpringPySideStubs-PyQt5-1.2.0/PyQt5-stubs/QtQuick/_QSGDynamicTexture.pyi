    **Detailed Description**

    To update the content of the texture, call **updateTexture** () explicitly.
    Simply calling **bind** () will not update the texture.

    **Note:** All classes with QSG prefix should be used solely on the scene
    graph's rendering thread. See **Scene Graph and Rendering**  for more
    information.

        **[pure virtual] bool QSGDynamicTexture::updateTexture()**

        Call this function to explicitly update the dynamic texture.

        The function returns true if the texture was changed as a resul of the
        update; otherwise returns false.

        **Note:** This function is typically called from
        **QQuickItem::updatePaintNode** () or **QSGNode::preprocess** (),
        meaning during the `synchronization` or the `node preprocessing` phases
        of the scenegraph. Calling it at other times is discouraged and can lead
        to unexpected behavior.

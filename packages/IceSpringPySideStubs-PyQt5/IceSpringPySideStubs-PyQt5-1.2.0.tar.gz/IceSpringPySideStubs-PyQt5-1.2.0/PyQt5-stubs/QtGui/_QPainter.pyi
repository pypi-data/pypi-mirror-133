    https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qpainter.html

    **Detailed Description**

    QPainter provides highly optimized functions to do most of the drawing GUI
    programs require. It can draw everything from simple lines to complex shapes
    like pies and chords. It can also draw aligned text and pixmaps. Normally,
    it draws in a "natural" coordinate system, but it can also do view and world
    transformation. QPainter can operate on any object that inherits the
    **QPaintDevice**  class.

    The common use of QPainter is inside a widget's paint event: Construct and
    customize (e.g. set the pen or the brush) the painter. Then draw. Remember
    to destroy the QPainter object after drawing. For example:

    void SimpleExampleWidget::paintEvent(**QPaintEvent**  *)
        {
    **QPainter**  painter(this);
            painter.setPen(Qt::blue);
    painter.setFont(**QFont** ("Arial", 30));
            painter.drawText(rect(),
    Qt::AlignCenter, "Qt");
        }

    The core functionality of QPainter is drawing, but the class also provide
    several functions that allows you to customize QPainter's settings and its
    rendering quality, and others that enable clipping. In addition you can
    control how different shapes are merged together by specifying the painter's
    composition mode.

    The **isActive** () function indicates whether the painter is active. A
    painter is activated by the **begin** () function and the constructor that
    takes a **QPaintDevice**  argument. The **end** () function, and the
    destructor, deactivates it.

    Together with the **QPaintDevice**  and **QPaintEngine**  classes, QPainter
    form the basis for Qt's paint system. QPainter is the class used to perform
    drawing operations. **QPaintDevice**  represents a device that can be
    painted on using a QPainter. **QPaintEngine**  provides the interface that
    the painter uses to draw onto different types of devices. If the painter is
    active, **device** () returns the paint device on which the painter paints,
    and **paintEngine** () returns the paint engine that the painter is
    currently operating on. For more information, see the **Paint System** .

    Sometimes it is desirable to make someone else paint on an unusual
    **QPaintDevice** . QPainter supports a static function to do this,
    setRedirected().

    **Warning:** When the paintdevice is a widget, QPainter can only be used
    inside a paintEvent() function or in a function called by paintEvent().

    **Settings**

    There are several settings that you can customize to make QPainter draw
    according to your preferences:

    * **font** () is the font used for drawing text. If the painter **isActive**
    (), you can retrieve information about the currently set font, and its
    metrics, using the **fontInfo** () and **fontMetrics** () functions
    respectively.
      * **brush** () defines the color or pattern that is used for
    filling shapes.
      * **pen** () defines the color or stipple that is used for
    drawing lines or boundaries.
      * **backgroundMode** () defines whether there
    is a **background** () or not, i.e it is either **Qt::OpaqueMode**  or
    **Qt::TransparentMode** .
      * **background** () only applies when
    **backgroundMode** () is **Qt::OpaqueMode**  and **pen** () is a stipple. In
    that case, it describes the color of the background pixels in the stipple.
    * **brushOrigin** () defines the origin of the tiled brushes, normally the
    origin of widget's background.
      * **viewport** (), **window** (),
    **worldTransform** () make up the painter's coordinate transformation
    system. For more information, see the **Coordinate Transformations**
    section and the **Coordinate System**  documentation.
      * **hasClipping** ()
    tells whether the painter clips at all. (The paint device clips, too.) If
    the painter clips, it clips to **clipRegion** ().
      * **layoutDirection** ()
    defines the layout direction used by the painter when drawing text.
      *
    **worldMatrixEnabled** () tells whether world transformation is enabled.
      *
    **viewTransformEnabled** () tells whether view transformation is enabled.

    Note that some of these settings mirror settings in some paint devices, e.g.
    **QWidget::font** (). The **QPainter::begin** () function (or equivalently
    the QPainter constructor) copies these attributes from the paint device.

    You can at any time save the QPainter's state by calling the **save** ()
    function which saves all the available settings on an internal stack. The
    **restore** () function pops them back.

    **Drawing**

    QPainter provides functions to draw most primitives: **drawPoint** (),
    **drawPoints** (), **drawLine** (), **drawRect** (), **drawRoundedRect** (),
    **drawEllipse** (), **drawArc** (), **drawPie** (), **drawChord** (),
    **drawPolyline** (), **drawPolygon** (), **drawConvexPolygon** () and
    drawCubicBezier(). The two convenience functions, **drawRects** () and
    **drawLines** (), draw the given number of rectangles or lines in the given
    array of **QRects**  or **QLines**  using the current pen and brush.

    The QPainter class also provides the **fillRect** () function which fills
    the given **QRect** , with the given **QBrush** , and the **eraseRect** ()
    function that erases the area inside the given rectangle.

    All of these functions have both integer and floating point versions.

    ![](images/qpainter-basicdrawing.png)**Basic Drawing Example**

    The **Basic
    Drawing**  example shows how to display basic graphics primitives in a
    variety of styles using the QPainter class.

    If you need to draw a complex shape, especially if you need to do so
    repeatedly, consider creating a **QPainterPath**  and drawing it using
    **drawPath** ().

    **Painter Paths example**

    The **QPainterPath**  class provides a container
    for painting operations, enabling graphical shapes to be constructed and
    reused.

    The **Painter Paths**  example shows how painter paths can be used
    to build complex shapes for rendering.

    ![](images/qpainter-
    painterpaths.png)

    QPainter also provides the **fillPath** () function which fills the given
    **QPainterPath**  with the given **QBrush** , and the **strokePath** ()
    function that draws the outline of the given path (i.e. strokes the path).

    See also the **Vector Deformation**  example which shows how to use advanced
    vector techniques to draw text using a **QPainterPath** , the **Gradients**
    example which shows the different types of gradients that are available in
    Qt, and the **Path Stroking**  example which shows Qt's built-in dash
    patterns and shows how custom patterns can be used to extend the range of
    available patterns.

    **Vector Deformation** **Gradients** **Path Stroking**
    ![](images/qpainter-vectordeformation.png)![](images/qpainter-
    gradients.png)![](images/qpainter-pathstroking.png)

    Text drawing is done using **drawText** (). When you need fine-grained
    positioning, **boundingRect** () tells you where a given **drawText** ()
    command will draw.

    **Drawing Pixmaps and Images**

    There are functions to draw pixmaps/images, namely **drawPixmap** (),
    **drawImage** () and **drawTiledPixmap** (). Both **drawPixmap** () and
    **drawImage** () produce the same result, except that **drawPixmap** () is
    faster on-screen while **drawImage** () may be faster on a **QPrinter**  or
    other devices.

    There is a **drawPicture** () function that draws the contents of an entire
    **QPicture** . The **drawPicture** () function is the only function that
    disregards all the painter's settings as **QPicture**  has its own settings.

    **Drawing High Resolution Versions of Pixmaps and Images**

    High resolution versions of pixmaps have a **device pixel ratio** value
    larger than 1 (see **QImageReader** , **QPixmap::devicePixelRatio** ()).
    Should it match the value of the underlying **QPaintDevice** , it is drawn
    directly onto the device with no additional transformation applied.

    This is for example the case when drawing a **QPixmap**  of 64x64 pixels
    size with a device pixel ratio of 2 onto a high DPI screen which also has a
    device pixel ratio of 2. Note that the pixmap is then effectively 32x32
    pixels in **user space**. Code paths in Qt that calculate layout geometry
    based on the pixmap size will use this size. The net effect of this is that
    the pixmap is displayed as high DPI pixmap rather than a large pixmap.

    **Rendering Quality**

    To get the optimal rendering result using QPainter, you should use the
    platform independent **QImage**  as paint device; i.e. using **QImage**
    will ensure that the result has an identical pixel representation on any
    platform.

    The QPainter class also provides a means of controlling the rendering
    quality through its **RenderHint**  enum and the support for floating point
    precision: All the functions for drawing primitives has a floating point
    version. These are often used in combination with the
    **QPainter::Antialiasing**  render hint.

    ![](images/qpainter-concentriccircles.png)**Concentric Circles Example**
    The **Concentric Circles**  example shows the improved rendering quality
    that can be obtained using floating point precision and anti-aliasing when
    drawing custom widgets.

    The application's main window displays several
    widgets which are drawn using the various combinations of precision and
    anti-aliasing.

    The **RenderHint**  enum specifies flags to QPainter that may or may not be
    respected by any given engine. **QPainter::Antialiasing**  indicates that
    the engine should antialias edges of primitives if possible,
    **QPainter::TextAntialiasing**  indicates that the engine should antialias
    text if possible, and the **QPainter::SmoothPixmapTransform**  indicates
    that the engine should use a smooth pixmap transformation algorithm.

    The **renderHints** () function returns a flag that specifies the rendering
    hints that are set for this painter. Use the **setRenderHint** () function
    to set or clear the currently set **RenderHints** .

    **Coordinate Transformations**

    Normally, the QPainter operates on the device's own coordinate system
    (usually pixels), but QPainter has good support for coordinate
    transformations.

    nop**rotate** ()**scale** ()**translate** ()
    ![](images/qpainter-
    clock.png)![](images/qpainter-rotation.png)![](images/qpainter-
    scale.png)![](images/qpainter-translation.png)

    The most commonly used transformations are scaling, rotation, translation
    and shearing. Use the **scale** () function to scale the coordinate system
    by a given offset, the **rotate** () function to rotate it clockwise and
    **translate** () to translate it (i.e. adding a given offset to the points).
    You can also twist the coordinate system around the origin using the
    **shear** () function. See the **Affine Transformations**  example for a
    visualization of a sheared coordinate system.

    See also the **Transformations**  example which shows how transformations
    influence the way that QPainter renders graphics primitives. In particular
    it shows how the order of transformations affects the result.

    **Affine Transformations Example**

    The **Affine Transformations**  example
    shows Qt's ability to perform affine transformations on painting operations.
    The demo also allows the user to experiment with the transformation
    operations and see the results immediately.

    ![](images/qpainter-
    affinetransformations.png)

    All the tranformation operations operate on the transformation
    **worldTransform** (). A matrix transforms a point in the plane to another
    point. For more information about the transformation matrix, see the
    **Coordinate System**  and **QTransform**  documentation.

    The **setWorldTransform** () function can replace or add to the currently
    set **worldTransform** (). The **resetTransform** () function resets any
    transformations that were made using **translate** (), **scale** (),
    **shear** (), **rotate** (), **setWorldTransform** (), **setViewport** ()
    and **setWindow** () functions. The **deviceTransform** () returns the
    matrix that transforms from logical coordinates to device coordinates of the
    platform dependent paint device. The latter function is only needed when
    using platform painting commands on the platform dependent handle, and the
    platform does not do transformations nativly.

    When drawing with QPainter, we specify points using logical coordinates
    which then are converted into the physical coordinates of the paint device.
    The mapping of the logical coordinates to the physical coordinates are
    handled by QPainter's **combinedTransform** (), a combination of
    **viewport** () and **window** () and **worldTransform** (). The
    **viewport** () represents the physical coordinates specifying an arbitrary
    rectangle, the **window** () describes the same rectangle in logical
    coordinates, and the **worldTransform** () is identical with the
    transformation matrix.

    See also **Coordinate System**

    **Clipping**

    QPainter can clip any drawing operation to a rectangle, a region, or a
    vector path. The current clip is available using the functions
    **clipRegion** () and **clipPath** (). Whether paths or regions are
    preferred (faster) depends on the underlying **paintEngine** (). For
    example, the **QImage**  paint engine prefers paths while the X11 paint
    engine prefers regions. Setting a clip is done in the painters logical
    coordinates.

    After QPainter's clipping, the paint device may also clip. For example, most
    widgets clip away the pixels used by child widgets, and most printers clip
    away an area near the edges of the paper. This additional clipping is not
    reflected by the return value of **clipRegion** () or **hasClipping** ().

    **Composition Modes**

    QPainter provides the **CompositionMode**  enum which defines the Porter-
    Duff rules for digital image compositing; it describes a model for combining
    the pixels in one image, the source, with the pixels in another image, the
    destination.

    The two most common forms of composition are **Source**  and **SourceOver**
    . **Source**  is used to draw opaque objects onto a paint device. In this
    mode, each pixel in the source replaces the corresponding pixel in the
    destination. In **SourceOver**  composition mode, the source object is
    transparent and is drawn on top of the destination.

    Note that composition transformation operates pixelwise. For that reason,
    there is a difference between using the graphic primitive itself and its
    bounding rectangle: The bounding rect contains pixels with alpha == 0 (i.e
    the pixels surrounding the primitive). These pixels will overwrite the other
    image's pixels, effectively clearing those, while the primitive only
    overwrites its own area.

    ![](images/qpainter-compositiondemo.png)**Composition Modes Example**

    The
    **Composition Modes**  example, available in Qt's examples directory, allows
    you to experiment with the various composition modes and see the results
    immediately.

    **Limitations**

    If you are using coordinates with Qt's raster-based paint engine, it is
    important to note that, while coordinates greater than +/- 215 can be used,
    any painting performed with coordinates outside this range is not guaranteed
    to be shown; the drawing may be clipped. This is due to the use of `short
    int` in the implementation.

    The outlines generated by Qt's stroker are only an approximation when
    dealing with curved shapes. It is in most cases impossible to represent the
    outline of a bezier curve segment using another bezier curve segment, and so
    Qt approximates the curve outlines by using several smaller curves. For
    performance reasons there is a limit to how many curves Qt uses for these
    outlines, and thus when using large pen widths or scales the outline error
    increases. To generate outlines with smaller errors it is possible to use
    the **QPainterPathStroker**  class, which has the setCurveThreshold member
    function which let's the user specify the error tolerance. Another
    workaround is to convert the paths to polygons first and then draw the
    polygons instead.

    **Performance**

    QPainter is a rich framework that allows developers to do a great variety of
    graphical operations, such as gradients, composition modes and vector
    graphics. And QPainter can do this across a variety of different hardware
    and software stacks. Naturally the underlying combination of hardware and
    software has some implications for performance, and ensuring that every
    single operation is fast in combination with all the various combinations of
    composition modes, brushes, clipping, transformation, etc, is close to an
    impossible task because of the number of permutations. As a compromise we
    have selected a subset of the QPainter API and backends, where performance
    is guaranteed to be as good as we can sensibly get it for the given
    combination of hardware and software.

    The backends we focus on as high-performance engines are:

    * Raster - This backend implements all rendering in pure software and is
    always used to render into QImages. For optimal performance only use the
    format types **QImage::Format_ARGB32_Premultiplied** ,
    **QImage::Format_RGB32**  or **QImage::Format_RGB16** . Any other format,
    including **QImage::Format_ARGB32** , has significantly worse performance.
    This engine is used by default for **QWidget**  and **QPixmap** .
      * OpenGL
    2.0 (ES) - This backend is the primary backend for hardware accelerated
    graphics. It can be run on desktop machines and embedded devices supporting
    the OpenGL 2.0 or OpenGL/ES 2.0 specification. This includes most graphics
    chips produced in the last couple of years. The engine can be enabled by
    using QPainter onto a **QOpenGLWidget** .

    These operations are:

    * Simple transformations, meaning translation and scaling, pluss 0, 90, 180,
    270 degree rotations.
      * `drawPixmap()` in combination with simple
    transformations and opacity with non-smooth transformation mode
    (`QPainter::SmoothPixmapTransform` not enabled as a render hint).
      *
    Rectangle fills with solid color, two-color linear gradients and simple
    transforms.
      * Rectangular clipping with simple transformations and
    intersect clip.
      * Composition Modes `QPainter::CompositionMode_Source` and
    **QPainter::CompositionMode_SourceOver** .
      * Rounded rectangle filling
    using solid color and two-color linear gradients fills.
      * 3x3 patched
    pixmaps, via qDrawBorderPixmap.

    This list gives an indication of which features to safely use in an
    application where performance is critical. For certain setups, other
    operations may be fast too, but before making extensive use of them, it is
    recommended to benchmark and verify them on the system where the software
    will run in the end. There are also cases where expensive operations are ok
    to use, for instance when the result is cached in a **QPixmap** .

    Drawing Example** , and **Drawing Utility Functions** .

        **QPainter::QPainter(QPaintDevice * device )**

        Constructs a painter that begins painting the paint **device**
        immediately.

        This constructor is convenient for short-lived painters, e.g. in a
        **QWidget::paintEvent** () and should be used only once. The constructor
        calls **begin** () for you and the QPainter destructor automatically
        calls **end** ().

        Here's an example using **begin** () and **end** ():

        void MyWidget::paintEvent(**QPaintEvent**  *)
            {
                **QPainter**
        p;
                p.begin(this);
                p.drawLine(...);        // drawing
        code
                p.end();
            }

        The same example using this constructor:

        void MyWidget::paintEvent(**QPaintEvent**  *)
            {
                **QPainter**
        p(this);
                p.drawLine(...);        // drawing code
            }

        Since the constructor cannot provide feedback when the initialization of
        the painter failed you should rather use **begin** () and **end** () to
        paint on external devices, e.g. printers.

        drawTiledPixmap() will produce the same visual tiling pattern on high-
        dpi displays (with devicePixelRatio > 1), compared to normal- dpi
        displays. Set the devicePixelRatio on the **pixmap** to control the tile
        size. For example, setting it to 2 halves the tile width and height (on
        both 1x and 2x displays), and produces high-resolution output on 2x
        displays.

        The **position** offset is always in the painter coordinate system,

        painter2->begin(myWidget); // impossible - only one painter at a time

        Note that most of the time, you can use one of the constructors instead
        of begin(), and that **end** () is automatically done at destruction.

        **Warning:** A paint device can only be painted by one painter at a
        time.

    **Detailed Description**

    This class is a tool for optimized drawing with **QPixmap** . You can use it
    to store temporary pixmaps that are expensive to generate without using more
    storage space than **cacheLimit** (). Use **insert** () to insert pixmaps,
    find() to find them, and **clear** () to empty the cache.

    QPixmapCache contains no member data, only static functions to access the
    global pixmap cache. It creates an internal **QCache**  object for caching
    the pixmaps.

    The cache associates a pixmap with a user-provided string as a key, or with
    a **QPixmapCache::Key**  that the cache generates. Using
    **QPixmapCache::Key**  for keys is faster than using strings. The string API
    is very convenient for complex keys but the **QPixmapCache::Key**  API will
    be very efficient and convenient for a one-to-one object-to-pixmap mapping -
    in this case, you can store the keys as members of an object.

    If two pixmaps are inserted into the cache using equal keys then the last
    pixmap will replace the first pixmap in the cache. This follows the behavior
    of the **QHash**  and **QCache**  classes.

    The cache becomes full when the total size of all pixmaps in the cache
    exceeds **cacheLimit** (). The initial cache limit is 10240 KB (10 MB); you
    can change this by calling **setCacheLimit** () with the required value. A
    pixmap takes roughly ( **width** * **height** * **depth** )/8 bytes of
    memory.

    The **Qt Quarterly** article **Optimizing with QPixmapCache**  explains how
    to use QPixmapCache to speed up applications by caching the results of
    painting.

    **Note:** QPixmapCache is only usable from the application's main thread.
    Access from other threads will be ignored and return failure.

        Replaces the pixmap associated with the given **key** with the
        **pixmap** specified. Returns `true` if the **pixmap** has been
        correctly inserted into the cache; otherwise returns `false`.

        the key for a future insertion.

        **[static] bool QPixmapCache::insert(const QString & key , const QPixmap
        & pixmap )**

        Inserts a copy of the pixmap **pixmap** associated with the **key** into
        the cache.

        All pixmaps inserted by the Qt library have a key starting with "$qt",
        so your own pixmap keys should never begin "$qt".

        When a pixmap is inserted and the cache is about to exceed its limit, it
        removes pixmaps until there is enough room for the pixmap to be
        inserted.

        The oldest pixmaps (least recently accessed in the cache) are deleted
        when more space is needed.

        The function returns `true` if the object was inserted into the cache;
        otherwise it returns `false`.

        Looks for a cached pixmap associated with the given **key** in the

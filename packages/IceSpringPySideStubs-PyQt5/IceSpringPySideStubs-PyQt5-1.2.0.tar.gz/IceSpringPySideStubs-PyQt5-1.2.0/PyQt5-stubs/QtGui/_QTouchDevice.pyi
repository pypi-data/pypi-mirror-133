    **Detailed Description**

    Each **QTouchEvent**  contains a QTouchDevice pointer to allow accessing
    device-specific properties like type and capabilities. It is the
    responsibility of the platform or generic plug-ins to register the available
    touch devices via QWindowSystemInterface before generating any touch events.
    Applications do not need to instantiate this class, they should just access
    the global instances pointed to by **QTouchEvent::device** ().

        Sets the **name** (a unique identifier) for the device. In most systems
        it is enough to leave this unset and keep the default empty name. This
        identifier becomes important when having multiple touch devices and a
        need to differentiate between them.

        This string may often be empty. It is however useful for systems that
        have more than one touch input device because there it can be used to
        differentiate between the devices (i.e. to tell from which device a
        **QTouchEvent**  originates from).

        **Note:** The returned list cannot be used to add new devices. To add a
        simulated touch screen for an autotest, **QTest::createTouchDevice** ()
        can be used. To add real touch screens to QPA plugins, the private
        `QWindowSystemInterface::registerTouchDevice()` function can be used.

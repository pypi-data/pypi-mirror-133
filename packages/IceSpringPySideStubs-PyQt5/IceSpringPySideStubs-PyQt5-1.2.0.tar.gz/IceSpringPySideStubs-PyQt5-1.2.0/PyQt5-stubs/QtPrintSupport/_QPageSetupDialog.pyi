    **Detailed Description**

    On Windows and macOS the page setup dialog is implemented using the native
    page setup dialogs.

    Note that on Windows and macOS custom paper sizes won't be reflected in the
    native page setup dialogs. Additionally, custom page margins set on a
    **QPrinter**  won't show in the native macOS page setup dialog.

    **See also** **QPrinter**  and **QPrintDialog** .

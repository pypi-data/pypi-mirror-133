    **Detailed Description**

    There are generated replicas (replicas having the header files produced by
    the **Replica Compiler** ), and dynamic replicas, which are generated on-
    the-fly. This is the class for the dynamic type of replica.

    When the connection to the **Source**  object is made, the initialization
    step passes the current property values (see **Replica Initialization** ).
    In a DynamicReplica, the property/signal/slot details are also sent,
    allowing the replica object to be created on-the-fly. This can be
    conventient in QML or scripting, but has two primary disadvantages. First,
    the object is in effect "empty" until it is successfully initialized by the
    **Source** . Second, in C++, calls must be made using
    **QMetaObject::invokeMethod** (), as the moc generated lookup will not be
    available.

    This class does not have a public constructor. It can only be instantiated
    by using the dynamic **QRemoteObjectNode::acquire**  method.

    **Detailed Description**

    Media services provide implementations of the functionality promised by
    media objects, and allow multiple providers to implement a **QMediaObject**
    .

    To provide the functionality of a **QMediaObject**  media services implement
    **QMediaControl**  interfaces. Services typically implement one core media
    control which provides the core feature of a media object, and some number
    of additional controls which provide either optional features of the media
    object, or features of a secondary media object or peripheral object.

    A pointer to media service's **QMediaControl**  implementation can be
    obtained by passing the control's interface name to the **requestControl**
    () function.

    **QMediaPlayerControl**  *control = qobject_cast<**QMediaPlayerControl**
    *>(
                mediaService->requestControl("org.qt-
    project.qt.mediaplayercontrol/5.0"));

    Media objects can use services loaded dynamically from plug-ins or
    implemented statically within an applications. Plug-in based services should
    also implement the **QMediaServiceProviderPlugin**  interface. Static
    services should implement the QMediaServiceProvider interface. In general,
    implementing a QMediaService is outside of the scope of this documentation
    and support on the relevant mailing lists or IRC channels should be sought.

    **See also** **QMediaObject**  and **QMediaControl** .

        null pointer is returned instead.

        Controls must be returned to the service when no longer needed using the
        **releaseControl** () function.

    **Detailed Description**

    The purpose of QWriteLocker (and **QReadLocker** ) is to simplify
    **QReadWriteLock**  locking and unlocking. Locking and unlocking statements
    or in exception handling code is error-prone and difficult to debug.
    QWriteLocker can be used in such situations to ensure that the state of the
    lock is always well-defined.

    Here's an example that uses QWriteLocker to lock and unlock a read-write
    lock for writing:

    **QReadWriteLock**  lock;

        void writeData(const **QByteArray**
    &data)
        {
            **QWriteLocker**  locker(&lock);
            ...
        }

    It is equivalent to the following code:

    **QReadWriteLock**  lock;

        void writeData(const **QByteArray**
    &data)
        {
            lock.lockForWrite();
            ...
            lock.unlock();
    }

    The **QMutexLocker**  documentation shows examples where the use of a locker
    object greatly simplifies programming.

        QWriteLocker does nothing.

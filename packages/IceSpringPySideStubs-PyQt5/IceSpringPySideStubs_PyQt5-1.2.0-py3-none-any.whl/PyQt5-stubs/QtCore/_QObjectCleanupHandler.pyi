    **Detailed Description**

    A QObjectCleanupHandler is useful whenever you need to know when a number of
    **QObject** s that are owned by someone else have been deleted. This is
    important, for example, when referencing memory in an application that has
    been allocated in a shared library.

    To keep track of some **QObject** s, create a QObjectCleanupHandler, and
    **add** () the objects you are interested in. If you are no longer
    interested in tracking a particular object, use **remove** () to remove it
    from the cleanup handler. If an object being tracked by the cleanup handler
    gets deleted by someone else it will automatically be removed from the
    cleanup handler. You can delete all the objects in the cleanup handler with
    **clear** (), or by destroying the cleanup handler. **isEmpty** () returns
    `true` if the QObjectCleanupHandler has no objects to keep track of.

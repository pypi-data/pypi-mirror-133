    **Detailed Description**

    Focus events are sent to widgets when the keyboard input focus changes.
    Focus events occur due to mouse actions, key presses (such as **Tab** or
    **Backtab** ), the window system, popup menus, keyboard shortcuts, or other
    application-specific reasons. The reason for a particular focus event is
    returned by **reason** () in the appropriate event handler.

    The event handlers **QWidget::focusInEvent** (), **QWidget::focusOutEvent**
    (), **QGraphicsItem::focusInEvent**  and **QGraphicsItem::focusOutEvent** ()
    receive focus events.

    **See also** **QWidget::setFocus** (), **QWidget::setFocusPolicy** (), and
    **Keyboard Focus in Widgets** .

    **Detailed Description**

    Native gesture events are generated by the operating system, typically by
    interpreting touch events. Gesture events are high-level events such as zoom
    or rotate.

    Event TypeDescriptionTouch sequence
    **Qt::ZoomNativeGesture**
    Magnification delta in percent.macOS: Two-finger pinch.
    **Qt::SmartZoomNativeGesture** Boolean magnification state.macOS: Two-finger
    douple tap (trackpad) / One-finger douple tap (magic mouse).
    **Qt::RotateNativeGesture** Rotation delta in degrees.macOS: Two-finger
    rotate.

    In addition, BeginNativeGesture and EndNativeGesture are sent before and
    after gesture event streams:

    BeginNativeGesture ZoomNativeGesture ZoomNativeGesture ZoomNativeGesture
    EndNativeGesture

    **Detailed Description**

    In the default implementation, supportsGeocoding() and
    supportsReverseGeocoding() returns false while **geocode** () and
    **reverseGeocode** () cause **QGeoCodeReply::UnsupportedOptionError**  to
    occur.

    If the service provider supports geocoding the subclass should provide an
    implementation of **geocode** () and call setSupportsGeocoding(true) at some
    point in time before **geocode** () is called.

    Similarly, if the service provider supports reverse geocoding the subclass
    should provide an implementation **reverseGeocode** () and call
    setSupportsReverseGeocoding(true) at some point in time before
    **reverseGeocode** () is called.

    A subclass of QGeoCodingManagerEngine will often make use of a subclass fo
    **QGeoCodeReply**  internally, in order to add any engine-specific data
    (such as a **QNetworkReply**  object for network-based services) to the
    **QGeoCodeReply**  instances used by the engine.

        **[virtual] QGeoCodeReply *QGeoCodingManagerEngine::reverseGeocode(const
        QGeoCoordinate & coordinate , const QGeoShape & bounds )**

        Begins the reverse geocoding of **coordinate**. Reverse geocoding is the
        process of finding an address that corresponds to a given coordinate.

        A **QGeoCodeReply**  object will be returned, which can be used to
        manage the reverse geocoding operation and to return the results of the
        operation.

        This engine and the returned **QGeoCodeReply**  object will emit signals
        indicating if the operation completes or if errors occur.

        If supportsReverseGeocoding() returns false an
        **QGeoCodeReply::UnsupportedOptionError**  will occur.

        At that point **QGeoCodeReply::locations** () can be used to retrieve
        the results, which will consist of a list of **QGeoLocation**  objects.
        These objects represent a combination of coordinate and address data.

        The coordinate data returned in the results may be different from
        **coordinate**. This will usually occur if the reverse geocoding service
        backend shifts the coordinates to be closer to the matching addresses,
        or if the backend returns results at multiple levels of detail.

        If multiple results are returned by the reverse geocoding service
        backend they will be provided in order of specificity. This normally
        occurs if the backend is configured to reverse geocode across multiple
        levels of detail. As an example, some services will return address and
        coordinate pairs for the street address, the city, the state and the
        country.

        If **bounds** is non-null and a valid **QGeoShape**  it will be used to
        limit the results to those that are contained by **bounds**.

        The user is responsible for deleting the returned reply object, although
        this can be done in the slot connected to
        **QGeoCodingManagerEngine::finished** (),
        **QGeoCodingManagerEngine::error** (), **QGeoCodeReply::finished** () or

        uses a different canonical form of addresses or if **address** was only

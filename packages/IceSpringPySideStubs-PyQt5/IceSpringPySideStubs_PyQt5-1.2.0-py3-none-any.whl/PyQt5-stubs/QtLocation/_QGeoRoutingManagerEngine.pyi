    **Detailed Description**

    Subclasses of QGeoRoutingManagerEngine need to provide an implementation of
    **calculateRoute** ().

    In the default implementation, supportsRouteUpdates() returns false and
    **updateRoute** () returns a **QGeoRouteReply**  object containing a
    **QGeoRouteReply::UnsupportedOptionError** .

    If the routing service supports updating routes as they are being traveled,
    the subclass should provide an implementation of **updateRoute** () and call
    setSupportsRouteUpdates(true) at some point in time before **updateRoute**
    () is called.

    The function setSupportsRouteUpdates() is one of several functions which
    configure the reported capabilities of the engine. If the capabilities of an
    engine differ from the default values these functions should be used so that
    the reported capabilities are accurate.

    It is important that this is done before **calculateRoute** (),
    **updateRoute** () or any of the capability reporting functions are used to
    prevent incorrect or inconsistent behavior.

    A subclass of QGeoRouteManagerEngine will often make use of a subclass fo
    **QGeoRouteReply**  internally, in order to add any engine-specific data
    (such as a **QNetworkReply**  object for network-based services) to the
    **QGeoRouteReply**  instances used by the engine.

    **See also** **QGeoRoutingManager** .

    **Detailed Description**

    Applications can share NDEF data or file content using NFC technology by
    tapping two NFC-enabled devices together. The QNearFieldShareManager
    provides a high level entry point to access this functionality.

    The class allows both NDEF data and/or files to be shared between two
    devices by calling the **setShareModes** () method. This method specifies
    either an NDEF Data and/or a File transfer. The **targetDetected** () signal
    is emitted each time a share target is detected. A **QNearFieldShareTarget**
    pointer is passed with the signal, which can be used to share either an NDEF
    message or one or more files.

    The process of sharing files via NFC involves other underlying communication
    transports such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct. It is implementation specific
    how and what type of transports are used to perform file transfer. The
    overall time taken to transfer content depends on the maximum speed of the
    transport used. Note that the process of sharing NDEF message/data does not
    require the use of other transports outside NFC.

    If an error occurs, **shareError** () returns the error type.

    Platforms that do not support both NDEF data and file content sharing modes
    can return the supported subset in the **supportedShareModes** () method.
    Applications that call **setShareModes** () with an unsupported mode will
    receive an error signal with a **UnsupportedShareModeError** .

    Since sharing data over NFC is effectively a data pipe between two processes
    (one on the sender and one of the receiver), the application developer
    should only create a single instance of QNearFieldShareManager per
    application. This avoids the possibility that different parts of the same
    application attempt to all consume data transferred over NFC.

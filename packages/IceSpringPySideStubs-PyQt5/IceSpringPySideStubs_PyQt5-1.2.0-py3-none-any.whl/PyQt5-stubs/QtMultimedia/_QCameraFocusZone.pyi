    **Detailed Description**

    For cameras that support autofocusing, in order for a camera to autofocus on
    part of a sensor frame, it considers different zones within the frame. Which
    zones to use, and where the zones are located vary between different
    cameras.

    This class exposes what zones are used by a particular camera, and a list of
    the zones can be retrieved by a **QCameraFocus**  instance.

    You can use this information to present visual feedback - for example,
    drawing rectangles around areas of the camera frame that are in focus, or
    changing the color of a zone as it comes into focus.

    focus->setFocusPointMode(**QCameraFocus** ::FocusPointAuto);
        const
    **QList** <QCameraFocusZone> zones = focus->focusZones();
        for (const
    QCameraFocusZone &zone : zones) {
            if (zone.status() ==
    QCameraFocusZone::Focused) {
                // Draw a green box at zone.area()
    } else if (zone.status() == QCameraFocusZone::Selected) {
                //
    This area is selected for autofocusing, but is not in focus
                //
    Draw a yellow box at zone.area()
            }
        }

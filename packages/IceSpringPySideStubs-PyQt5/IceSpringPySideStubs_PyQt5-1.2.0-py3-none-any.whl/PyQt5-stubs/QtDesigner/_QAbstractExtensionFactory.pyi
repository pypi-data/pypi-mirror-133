    **Detailed Description**

    QAbstractExtensionFactory is not intended to be instantiated directly; use
    the **QExtensionFactory**  instead.

    In **Qt Designer** , extension factories are used to look up and create
    named extensions as they are required. For that reason, when implementing a
    custom extension, you must also create a **QExtensionFactory** , i.e a class
    that is able to make an instance of your extension, and register it using
    **Qt Designer** 's **extension manager** .

    When an extension is required, **Qt Designer** 's **extension manager**
    will run through all its registered factories calling
    **QExtensionFactory::createExtension** () for each until the first one that
    is able to create the requested extension for the selected object, is found.
    This factory will then make an instance of the extension.

    **See also** **QExtensionFactory**  and **QExtensionManager** .

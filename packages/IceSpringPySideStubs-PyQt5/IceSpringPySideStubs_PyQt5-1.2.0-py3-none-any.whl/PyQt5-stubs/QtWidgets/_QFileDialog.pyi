class QFileDialog(QDialog):
    """
    https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qfiledialog.html

    **Detailed Description**

    The QFileDialog class enables a user to traverse the file system in order to
    select one or many files or a directory.

    The easiest way to create a QFileDialog is to use the static functions.

    fileName = **QFileDialog** ::getOpenFileName(this,
            tr("Open Image"),
    "/home/jana", tr("Image Files (*.png *.jpg *.bmp)"));

    In the above example, a modal QFileDialog is created using a static
    function. The dialog initially displays the contents of the "/home/jana"
    directory, and displays files matching the patterns given in the string
    "Image Files (*.png *.jpg *.bmp)". The parent of the file dialog is set to
    **this** , and the window title is set to "Open Image".

    If you want to use multiple filters, separate each one with **two**
    semicolons. For example:

    "Images (*.png *.xpm *.jpg);;Text files (*.txt);;XML files (*.xml)"

    You can create your own QFileDialog without using the static functions. By
    calling **setFileMode** (), you can specify what the user must select in the
    dialog:

    **QFileDialog**  dialog(this);
        dialog.setFileMode(**QFileDialog**
    ::AnyFile);

    In the above example, the mode of the file dialog is set to **AnyFile** ,
    meaning that the user can select any file, or even specify a file that
    doesn't exist. This mode is useful for creating a "Save As" file dialog. Use
    **ExistingFile**  if the user must select an existing file, or **Directory**
    if only a directory may be selected. See the **QFileDialog::FileMode**  enum
    for the complete list of modes.

    The **fileMode**  property contains the mode of operation for the dialog;
    this indicates what types of objects the user is expected to select. Use
    **setNameFilter** () to set the dialog's file filter. For example:

    dialog.setNameFilter(tr("Images (*.png *.xpm *.jpg)"));

    In the above example, the filter is set to `"Images (*.png *.xpm *.jpg)"`,
    this means that only files with the extension `png`, `xpm`, or `jpg` will be
    shown in the QFileDialog. You can apply several filters by using
    **setNameFilters** (). Use **selectNameFilter** () to select one of the
    filters you've given as the file dialog's default filter.

    The file dialog has two view modes: **List**  and **Detail** . **List**
    presents the contents of the current directory as a list of file and
    directory names. **Detail**  also displays a list of file and directory
    names, but provides additional information alongside each name, such as the
    file size and modification date. Set the mode with **setViewMode** ():

    dialog.setViewMode(**QFileDialog** ::Detail);

    The last important function you will need to use when creating your own file
    dialog is **selectedFiles** ().

    **QStringList**  fileNames;
        if (dialog.exec())
            fileNames =
    dialog.selectedFiles();

    In the above example, a modal file dialog is created and shown. If the user
    clicked OK, the file they selected is put in `fileName`.

    The dialog's working directory can be set with **setDirectory** (). Each
    file in the current directory can be selected using the **selectFile** ()
    function.

    The **Standard Dialogs**  example shows how to use QFileDialog as well as
    other built-in Qt dialogs.

    By default, a platform-native file dialog will be used if the platform has
    one. In that case, the widgets which would otherwise be used to construct
    the dialog will not be instantiated, so related accessors such as **layout**
    () and **itemDelegate** () will return null. You can set the
    **DontUseNativeDialog**  option to ensure that the widget-based
    implementation will be used instead of the native dialog.

        This function is used to save files to the local file system on Qt for
        WebAssembly, where the web sandbox places restrictions on how such

        native file dialog, where the user makes the file selection.

        It can also be used on other platforms, where it will fall back to using
        **QFileDialog** .

        The function is asynchronous and returns immediately.

        `clsid:374DE290-123F-4565-9164-39C4925E467B` denotes the download
        location. For a complete list of possible values, see the MSDN

        Note that the filter ***.*** is not portable, because the historical
        assumption that the file extension determines the file type is not

        dialog, ***.*** will match such files, while in other types of file
        dialogs it may not. So it is better to use ***** if you mean to select
        any file.

        **setMimeTypeFilters** () has the advantage of providing all possible
        name filters for each file type. For example, JPEG images have three
        possible extensions; if your application can open such files, selecting
        the `image/jpeg` mime type as a filter will allow you to open all of
        them.

        This is a convenience static function that will return a file name
        selected by the user. The file does not have to exist.

        It creates a modal file dialog with the given **parent** widget. If
        **parent** is not `nullptr`, the dialog will be shown centered over the
        parent widget.

        **QString**  fileName = **QFileDialog** ::getSaveFileName(this, tr("Save
        File"),
                                       "/home/jana/untitled.png",
        tr("Images (*.png *.xpm *.jpg)"));

        The file dialog's working directory will be set to **dir**. If **dir**
        includes a file name, the file will be selected. Only files that match
        the **filter** are shown. The filter selected is set to
        **selectedFilter**. The parameters **dir** , **selectedFilter** , and
        **filter** may be empty strings. Multiple filters are separated with
        ';;'. For instance:

        "Images (*.png *.xpm *.jpg);;Text files (*.txt);;XML files (*.xml)"

        The **options** argument holds various options about how to run the
        dialog, see the **QFileDialog::Option**  enum for more information on
        the flags you can pass.

        The default filter can be chosen by setting **selectedFilter** to the
        desired value.

        The dialog's caption is set to **caption**. If **caption** is not
        specified, a default caption will be used.

        On Windows, and macOS, this static function will use the native file
        dialog and not a **QFileDialog** .

        On Windows the dialog will spin a blocking modal event loop that will
        not dispatch any QTimers, and if **parent** is not `nullptr` then it
        will position the dialog just below the parent's title bar. On macOS,
        with its native file dialog, the filter argument is ignored.

        On Unix/X11, the normal behavior of the file dialog is to resolve and
        follow symlinks. For example, if `/usr/tmp` is a symlink to `/var/tmp`,
        the file dialog will change to `/var/tmp` after entering `/usr/tmp`. If
        **options** includes **DontResolveSymlinks**  the file dialog will treat
        symlinks as regular directories.

        **Warning:** Do not delete **parent** during the execution of the
        dialog. If you want to do this, you should create the dialog yourself
        using one of the **QFileDialog**  constructors.

        **QStringList**  files = **QFileDialog** ::getOpenFileNames(
        this,
                                    "Select one or more files to open",
        "/home",
                                    "Images (*.png *.xpm *.jpg)");

        This function creates a modal file dialog with the given **parent**
        widget. If **parent** is not `nullptr`, the dialog will be shown
        centered over the parent widget.

        The file dialog's working directory will be set to **dir**. If **dir**
        includes a file name, the file will be selected. The filter is set to
        **filter** so that only those files which match the filter are shown.
        The filter selected is set to **selectedFilter**. The parameters **dir**
        , **selectedFilter** and **filter** may be empty strings. If you need
        multiple filters, separate them with ';;', for instance:

        "Images (*.png *.xpm *.jpg);;Text files (*.txt);;XML files (*.xml)"

        The dialog's caption is set to **caption**. If **caption** is not
        specified then a default caption will be used.

        On Windows, and macOS, this static function will use the native file
        dialog and not a **QFileDialog** .

        On Windows the dialog will spin a blocking modal event loop that will
        not dispatch any QTimers, and if **parent** is not `nullptr` then it
        will position the dialog just below the parent's title bar.

        On Unix/X11, the normal behavior of the file dialog is to resolve and
        follow symlinks. For example, if `/usr/tmp` is a symlink to `/var/tmp`,
        the file dialog will change to `/var/tmp` after entering `/usr/tmp`. The
        **options** argument holds various options about how to run the dialog,
        see the **QFileDialog::Option**  enum for more information on the flags
        you can pass.

        **Warning:** Do not delete **parent** during the execution of the
        dialog. If you want to do this, you should create the dialog yourself
        using one of the **QFileDialog**  constructors.

        This is a convenience static function that will return an existing
        directory selected by the user. If the user presses Cancel, it returns
        an empty url.

        The function is used similarly to **QFileDialog::getExistingDirectory**
        (). In particular **parent** , **caption** , **dir** and **options** are
        used in the exact same way.

        The main difference with **QFileDialog::getExistingDirectory** () comes
        from the ability offered to the user to select a remote directory.
        That's why the return type and the type of **dir** is **QUrl** .

        The **supportedSchemes** argument allows to restrict the type of URLs
        the user will be able to select. It is a way for the application to
        declare the protocols it will support to fetch the file content. An
        empty list means that no restriction is applied (the default). Supported
        for local files ("file" scheme) is implicit and always enabled; it is
        not necessary to include it in the restriction.

        When possible, this static function will use the native file dialog and
        not a **QFileDialog** . On platforms which don't support selecting
        remote files, Qt will allow to select only local files.

        This function was introduced in Qt 5.2.

        This is a convenience static function that will return an existing
        directory selected by the user.

        **QString**  dir = **QFileDialog** ::getExistingDirectory(this, tr("Open
        Directory"),
        "/home",
        **QFileDialog** ::ShowDirsOnly
        | **QFileDialog** ::DontResolveSymlinks);

        This function creates a modal file dialog with the given **parent**
        widget. If **parent** is not `nullptr`, the dialog will be shown
        centered over the parent widget.

        The dialog's working directory is set to **dir** , and the caption is
        set to **caption**. Either of these may be an empty string in which case
        the current directory and a default caption will be used respectively.

        The **options** argument holds various options about how to run the
        dialog, see the **QFileDialog::Option**  enum for more information on
        the flags you can pass. To ensure a native file dialog, **ShowDirsOnly**
        must be set.

        On Windows and macOS, this static function will use the native file
        dialog and not a **QFileDialog** . However, the native Windows file
        dialog does not support displaying files in the directory chooser. You
        need to pass **DontUseNativeDialog**  to display files using a
        **QFileDialog** .

        On Unix/X11, the normal behavior of the file dialog is to resolve and
        follow symlinks. For example, if `/usr/tmp` is a symlink to `/var/tmp`,
        the file dialog will change to `/var/tmp` after entering `/usr/tmp`. If
        **options** includes **DontResolveSymlinks** , the file dialog will
        treat symlinks as regular directories.

        Sets the file dialog's current **directory**.

        **Note:** On iOS, if you set **directory** to **QStandardPaths::standard
        Locations(QStandardPaths::PicturesLocation).last()** , a native image
        picker dialog will be used for accessing the user's photo album. The
        filename returned can be loaded using **QFile**  and related APIs. For
        this to be enabled, the Info.plist assigned to **QMAKE_INFO_PLIST**  in
        the project file must contain the key `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`.
        See Info.plist documentation from Apple for more information regarding
        this key. This feature was added in Qt 5.5.

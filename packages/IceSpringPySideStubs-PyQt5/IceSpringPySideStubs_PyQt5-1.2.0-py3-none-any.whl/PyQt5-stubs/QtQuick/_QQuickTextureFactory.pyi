    **Detailed Description**

    The purpose of the texture factory is to provide a placeholder for a image
    data that can be converted into an OpenGL texture.

    Creating a texture directly is not possible as there is rarely an OpenGL
    context available in the thread that is responsible for loading the image
    data.

        **QQuickTextureFactory::QQuickTextureFactory()**

        Constructs a texture factory. Since QQuickTextureFactory is abstract, it
        cannot be instantiated directly.

        **[static] QQuickTextureFactory
        *QQuickTextureFactory::textureFactoryForImage(const QImage & image )**

        Returns a **QQuickTextureFactory**  holding the given **image**.

        This is typically used as a helper in
        **QQuickImageResponse::textureFactory** .

        This function was introduced in Qt 5.6.

        https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qquicktexturefactory.html#image

        **[virtual] QImage QQuickTextureFactory::image() const**

        Returns an image version of this texture.

        The lifespan of the returned image is unknown, so the implementation
        should return a self contained **QImage** , not make use of the
        **QImage** (uchar *, ...) constructor.

        This function is not commonly used and is expected to be slow.

        **[pure virtual] int QQuickTextureFactory::textureByteCount() const**

        Returns the number of bytes of memory the texture consumes.

        https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qquicktexturefactory.html#textureSize

        **[pure virtual] QSize QQuickTextureFactory::textureSize() const**

        Returns the size of the texture. This function will be called from
        arbitrary threads and should not rely on an OpenGL context bound.

    def createTexture(self, window: "QQuickWindow") -> "QSGTexture":
        """

        **[pure virtual] QSGTexture
        *QQuickTextureFactory::createTexture(QQuickWindow * window ) const**

        This function is called on the scene graph rendering thread to create a
        **QSGTexture**  instance from the factory. **window** provides the
        context which this texture is created in.

        QML will internally cache the returned texture as needed. Each call to
        this function should return a unique instance.

        The OpenGL context used for rendering is bound when this function is
        called.

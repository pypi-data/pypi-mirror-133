    **Detailed Description**

    QDBusInterface is a generic accessor class that is used to place calls to
    remote objects, connect to signals exported by remote objects and get/set
    the value of remote properties. This class is useful for dynamic access to
    remote objects: that is, when you do not have a generated code that
    represents the remote interface.

    Calls are usually placed by using the **call** () function, which constructs
    the message, sends it over the bus, waits for the reply and decodes the
    reply. Signals are connected to by using the normal **QObject::connect** ()
    function. Finally, properties are accessed using the **QObject::property**
    () and **QObject::setProperty** () functions.

    The following code snippet demonstrates how to perform a mathematical
    operation of `"2 + 2"` in a remote application called
    `com.example.Calculator`, accessed via the session bus.

    QDBusInterface remoteApp( "com.example.Calculator",
    "/Calculator/Operations",
    "org.mathematics.RPNCalculator" );
        remoteApp.call( "PushOperand", 2 );
    remoteApp.call( "PushOperand", 2 );
        remoteApp.call( "ExecuteOperation",
    "+" );
        **QDBusReply** <int> reply = remoteApp.call( "PopOperand" );
    if ( reply.isValid() )
            printf( "%d", reply.value() );          //
    prints 4

        Creates a dynamic QDBusInterface object associated with the interface
        **interface** on object at path **path** on service **service** , using
        the given **connection**. If **interface** is an empty string, the
        object created will refer to the merging of all interfaces found by
        introspecting that object. Otherwise if **interface** is not empty, the
        QDBusInterface object will be cached to speedup further creations of the
        same interface.

        **parent** is passed to the base class constructor.

        If the remote service **service** is not present or if an error occurs
        trying to obtain the description of the remote interface **interface** ,
        the object created will not be valid (see **isValid** ()).

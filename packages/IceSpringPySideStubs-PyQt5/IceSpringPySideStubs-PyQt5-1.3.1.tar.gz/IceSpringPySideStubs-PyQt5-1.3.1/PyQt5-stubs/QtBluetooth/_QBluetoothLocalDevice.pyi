    **Detailed Description**

    QBluetoothLocalDevice provides functions for getting and setting the state
    of local Bluetooth devices.

    On iOS and Windows, this class cannot be used because the platform does not
    expose any data or API which may provide information on the local Bluetooth
    device.

        **[slot] void QBluetoothLocalDevice::pairingConfirmation(bool
        confirmation )**

        To be called after getting a **pairingDisplayConfirmation** (). The
        **confirmation** parameter either accepts the pairing or rejects it.

        Accepting a pairing always refers to the last pairing request issued via
        **requestPairing** ().

        **Note:** This function requires BLUETOOTH_PRIVILEGED permission on
        Android which is generally not obtainable for 3rdparty. Android's
        default handler for pairing requests will do this on behalf of the user
        and the application can ignore this call. Nevertheless the proper
        Android calls are made in case the application does have the required
        permissions.

        **QList<QBluetoothAddress> QBluetoothLocalDevice::connectedDevices()
        const**

        Returns the list of connected devices. This list is different from the
        list of currently paired devices.

        On Android and macOS, it is not possible to retrieve a list of connected
        devices. It is only possible to listen to (dis)connect changes. For
        convenience, this class monitors all connect and disconnect events since
        its instanciation and returns the current list when calling this
        function. Therefore it is possible that this function returns an empty
        list shortly after creating an instance.

        This function was introduced in Qt 5.3.

        **Note:** On Android, this function always returns the constant value
        `02:00:00:00:00:00` as local address starting with Android 6.0. The

        **Note:** Due to varying security policies on the supported platforms,
        this method may have differing behaviors on the various platforms. For
        example the system may ask the user for confirmation before turning
        Bluetooth on or off. On macOS it is not possible to power on/off
        Bluetooth. Please refer to the platform specific Bluetooth documentation

        On macOS, it is not possible to unpair a device. If Unpaired is
        requested, **pairingFinished** () is immediately emitted although the

        previously unpaired device. In addition **AuthorizedPaired**  has the
        same behavior as **Paired** .

        If the local Bluetooth adapter represented by an instance of this class
        is removed from the system (e.g. removal of the underlying Bluetooth
        dongle) then this instance will become invalid. An already invalid

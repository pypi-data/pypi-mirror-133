    **Detailed Description**

    QQmlFileSelector will automatically apply a **QFileSelector**  to qml file
    and asset paths.

    It is used as follows:

    **QQmlEngine**  engine;
        **QQmlFileSelector** * selector = new
    **QQmlFileSelector** (&engine);

    Then you can swap out files like so:

    main.qml
        Component.qml
        asset.png
        +unix/Component.qml
    +mac/asset.png

    In this example, main.qml will normally use Component.qml for the Component
    type. However on a unix platform, the unix selector will be present and the
    +unix/Component.qml version will be used instead. Note that this acts like
    swapping out Component.qml with +unix/Component.qml, so when using
    Component.qml you should not need to alter any paths based on which version
    was selected.

    For example, to pass the "asset.png" file path around you would refer to it
    just as "asset.png" in all of main.qml, Component.qml, and
    +linux/Component.qml. It will be replaced with +mac/asset.png on Mac
    platforms in all cases.

    For a list of available selectors, see `QFileSelector`.

    Your platform may also provide additional selectors for you to use. As
    specified by **QFileSelector** , directories used for selection must start
    with a '+' character, so you will not accidentally trigger this feature
    unless you have directories with such names inside your project.

    If a new QQmlFileSelector is set on the engine, the old one will be
    replaced. Use **QQmlFileSelector::get** () to query or use the existing
    instance.

Description: Jasmine is a Behavior Driven Development testing framework for JavaScript. It does not rely on browsers, DOM, or any JavaScript framework. Thus it's suited for websites, Node.js (http://nodejs.org) projects, or anywhere that JavaScript can run.
        
        The Jasmine packages for Python are deprecated. There will be no further
        releases after the end of the Jasmine 3.x series. We recommend migrating to the
        following options:
        
        * jasmine-browser-runner (<https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-browser>,
          `npm install jasmine-browser-runner`) to run specs in browsers, including
          headless Chrome and Saucelabs. This is the most direct replacement for the
          jasmine server` and `jasmine ci` commands provided by the `jasmine` Python
          package.
        * The jasmine npm package (<https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm>,
          `npm install jasmine`) to run specs under Node.js.
        * The standalone distribution from the latest Jasmine release
          <https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases> to run specs in browsers with
          no additional tools.
        * The jasmine-core npm package (`npm install jasmine-core`) if all you need is
          the Jasmine assets. This is the direct equivalent of the jasmine-core Python
          package.
        
        Except for the standalone distribution, all of the above are distributed through
        npm.

Description: # Pii Manager
        
        This repository builds a Python package that performs PII processing for text
        data i.e. replacement/tagging/extraction of PII (Personally Identifiable
        Information aka Personal Data) items existing in the text.
        
        The PII Tasks in the package are structured by language & country, since many
        of the PII elements are language- and/or -country dependent.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        The package needs at least Python 3.8, and uses the python-stdnum package to
        validate identifiers.
        
        ## Usage
        
        The package can be used:
         * As an API, in two flavors: function-based API and object-based API
         * As a command-line tool
        
        For details, see the usage document.
        
        
        ## Building
        
        The provided Makefile can be used to process the package:
         * `make pkg` will build the Python package, creating a file that can be
           installed with `pip`
         * `make unit` will launch all unit tests (using pytest, so pytest must be
           available)
         * `make install` will install the package in a Python virtualenv. The
           virtualenv will be chosen as, in this order:
             - the one defined in the `VENV` environment variable, if it is defined
             - if there is a virtualenv activated in the shell, it will be used
             - otherwise, a default is chosen as `/opt/venv/bigscience` (it will be
               created if it does not exist)

Description: finger (RFC 1288) server-side daemon
        ====================================
        
        finger is both a protocol and a utility to get the information and status
        from a user on a distant machine. It was standardized in `RFC 742`_
        in 1977, then in `RFC 1288`_ in 1991, and has been abandoned since.
        
        While describing the protocol in `a blog post of mine`_, I wanted
        to implement this protocol for fun, but didn't want to present the
        real information about the users on my server, so I made this to present
        some fictional information in order to be able to tell a story through
        finger.

        What is left to do
        ------------------
        
        For further versions:
        
        - add a live action interface (where a port/socket is opened and updates
          are read and applied through it).
        - make external commands or actions from a scenario, to make it more
          believable! although this might need a switch from outside the scenario
          to be sure this behaviour is wanted (e.g. a CLI/env option).
        - add a Win32 native interface.

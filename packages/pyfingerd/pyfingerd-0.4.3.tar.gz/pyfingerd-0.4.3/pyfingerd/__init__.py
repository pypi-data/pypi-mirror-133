""" Pure Python finger protocol implementation.

    finger is both a protocol and a utility to get the information and
    status from a user on a distant machine. It was standardized in RFC 742
    in 1977, then in RFC 1288 in 1991, and has been abandoned by most
    people since.

    This Python module is a finger server implementation that allows you
    to give out real information as well as fictional information.
